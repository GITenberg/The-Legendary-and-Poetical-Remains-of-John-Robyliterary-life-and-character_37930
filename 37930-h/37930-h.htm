<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The poetry and tales constituting the main part of the
present volume, need no apology or introduction. Most
of them were finished for publication by the author.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>But in reference to the biographical sketch which
precedes them, a few words will not be out of place.</p>

<p>A life so private afforded but few materials. Incidents
of early days, tending to illustrate the bent and
development of his powers, are derived from memoranda
in Mr. Roby's own handwriting, or from well-remembered
conversations. The absence of that unconscious
self-portraiture, which a man's own letters
present, will be found supplied, to some extent, by
short reminiscences, kindly furnished by friends. The
memoir is not offered as a complete biography. It is
simply an outline of a literary life, and of a character;
the one as varied in its aspect, as the other was uniform
in its tenor. That part of the life which fell under the
writer's own observation, has of necessity been dwelt
on most at length, and she fears lest too much prominence
may at times have been given to what is
personal to herself, and the double life be thus too
strongly shown. Yet the shadow that brings out the
principal object will scarcely be censured. No one can
feel so deeply as herself the inadequacy of her talents
to the subject. To one qualification alone she may lay
claim, without fear of the charge of presumption, "that
of the seeing heart," without which it has been truly
said, "no <i>true</i> seeing for the head is so much as
possible."</p>

<p>The writer will esteem herself happy if, with all the
imperfections of detail, she shall, in a measure, have
succeeded in her aim. That aim has been to gather up,
with a loving reverence, the scattered products of her
husband's pen, by which the reader may estimate his
powers, and to present a faithful mental portrait of one,
with whom the pursuit of literature was no bar to the
discharge of ordinary duties, and whose gifts were the
Lares and Penates of his own fireside,&mdash;one who, as
time advanced, learned the secret of self-renunciation
and spiritual obedience, and having "left this life for a
better," still, lives "in memory here," as a man of genius
and a Christian.</p>

<h2>SKETCH,</h2>

<h5>&amp;c, &amp;c.</h5>


<p>When an author's name is chiefly known by a work
connected with any particular locality, our natural expectations
are gratified in finding that personal or
family associations drew his attention to the subject.
This was the case with the author of "The Traditions
of Lancashire." Born in a neighbourhood where the
faint legends of the olden time were yet floating, he
himself belonged to the district whose memorials he
perpetuated. He was attached to his native county,
proud of her wild scenery, of her old historic associations,
and of the energetic, well-defined character of
her sons. His family name was not unknown in her
annals. One of his ancestors, Captain Roby, who was
born in an old mansion, long since pulled down, in the
township of Roby, near Liverpool, was distinguished
by his courage and gallant conduct during the civil
wars of the seventeenth century, at the time when the
north was the scene of operations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Roby</span> was born at Wigan, the 5th of January<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
1793. From his father, <span class="smcap">Nehemiah Roby</span>, who was
for many years master of the grammar-school at Haigh,
he inherited a fine constitution and unbending principles
of honour and integrity. From the family of his
mother, <span class="smcap">Mary Aspull</span>, he derived the quick impressible
temperament of genius and that love of humour
which so conspicuously marks the Lancashire character.</p>

<p>Destitute of home companions of his own age, being
by many years the youngest of the family, he often
suffered from an oppressive sense of loneliness. One
of his strongest characteristics was an intense yearning
for sympathy, however concealed in after-life, from the
general eye, by the exuberance of his natural spirits.
This led him to seek companionship with inanimate
things, which he invested with a sympathetic existence.
A reflected light proceeding from the surface of water
in a butt at the back of the house, which frequently
played on the upper wall of the staircase, was one of
these friendly objects. Ignorant of the cause, he would
watch for its coming, and sit for hours in communion
with the strange and beautiful appearance. It was to
him a fair and mysterious visitant, who came in pure
benevolence to cheer his solitude. Indicative of the
dramatic bent of his mind was another of his resources.
He was accustomed to cut out little paper figures of
men and women, which he would carry to bed and
place under his pillow. As soon as the light was
withdrawn he delighted himself in conversations with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
his paper friends, losing his sense of loneliness in their
ideal companionship.</p>

<p>Another thing contributed to deepen his unsatisfied
longing for sympathy. His father revered the sterner
virtues, and sacrificed to them whatever he apprehended
might tend to enervate his son's character. In conformity
with this theory of training, even the maternal
kiss was forbidden. Only once did he remember
feeling the soft pressure of his mother's lips on his
cheek, though frequently and fervently did he long to
feel it again. In after-life, even down to its close, when
rejoicing in the sunshine of confiding and playful affection,
he would refer with tears in his eyes to the lonely
and unfondled years of childhood. For the sake of both,
deeply was it to be regretted, that a mother's love of
her latest born, one of the strongest of human affections,
should be denied its natural expression, repressed as a
duty, till it was subdued and its very existence scarcely
suspected.</p>

<p>His thirst for knowledge was early and strongly
manifested. If his inquiries were neglected or evaded,
he would insist on an intelligible reply. Having been
once told, not to be so inquisitive, "'Inquisitive' wants
to know" was ever after his form of urgent appeal.
Characteristic of this disposition was an incident which
occurred when he was a child in petticoats. One fine
afternoon 'Inquisitive' was seated in a low chair by his
mother's side, conning his lesson. He loved not a task
from which he gained no idea; the spelling of <i>t-h-e</i>, <i>the</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<i>f-o-r</i>, <i>for</i>, was wearisome, and, as an expedient to rid
himself of it, he feigned sleep: his father entering the
room remarked, "John is asleep: this warm afternoon
has made him drowsy." The mother knew the pranks
of childhood, and quietly replied, "He is only sleeping
dog's sleep." There was a new idea: up started the
little head in a moment with the inquiry, "What is
dog's sleep, mother?" Even at that early age, when a
question suggested itself, he could not rest till he had
arrived at a satisfactory answer; often and long would
he ponder over some little thing that puzzled him, and
on which he could gain no information from others beyond
the unsatisfactory reply "Why, <i>so it is</i>."</p>

<p>As he grew up into boyhood surrounded by objects
to which tradition had assigned her marvellous stories,
they sank silently into his companionless and sensitive
spirit. In his immediate vicinity were Haigh Hall,
and Mab's Cross, the scenes of Lady Mabel's sufferings
and penance&mdash;the subject of one of his earliest tales.
Almost within sight of the windows through which,
with the dreamy gaze of childhood, he first looked on
earth and sky, lay the fine range of hills of which
Rivington Pike is a spur. Never will be forgotten the
pleasure with which, fifty years afterwards, during the
last summer of his life, when travelling past that neighbourhood,
he pointed out the roof and chimneys of his
birthplace, the well-remembered hills as they lay with
the beautiful light of the afternoon sun upon them,
Hoghton Tower crowning its woody steep, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
spots at once the haunts of early days and the scenes
of the legends he afterwards so beautifully re-imbodied.</p>

<p>His various talents were very early called forth.
While yet a child he was accustomed, at first occasionally,
and then regularly, to take the organ at the
Countess of Huntingdon's Chapel, Wigan, during the
Sunday service. His ear was exquisitely true, and his
voice also excellent; but, used too freely at the period
of its change, it never afterwards fully regained its
tone.</p>

<p>His first attempt at drawing was made when he was
a very little fellow. A lady with whom he was a
special favourite&mdash;Miss Leigh, sister of the late Sir
Robert Holt Leigh&mdash;had one day, to his great delight,
been showing him some sketches, when, after he had
looked at them, she placed the drawing of a cow before
him, saying,</p>

<p>"Now cannot you draw that cow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I never did such a thing," was his reply;</p>

<p>"Try," her wise rejoinder.</p>

<p>With some persuasion the volatile child was induced
to attempt the task. The pencil was poised&mdash;his
attention concentrated on the subject&mdash;his hand began
to follow the eye, and with oft-repeated delight he
beheld the form grow rapidly under his touch; so that
whether his teacher or himself was the more pleased, it
would be difficult to say. This was a precious lesson
to him, which he did not forget. It was so firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
rooted, that, in after-life, he never doubted success in
anything he thought proper to attempt. Years after,
in 1849, when writing to a friend whom he wished to
encourage to mental effort, he referred to this time, when
the little word "Try" was the "Open Sesame" of the
"Arabian Nights" to him.</p>

<p>He cared little for ordinary companions, never so
happy as when he could steal away from them, into the
company of such of the other sex as were much older
than himself, and listen for hours to song and music.
He always considered he was more indebted for the
formation of his habits and the development of his
character and talents, as in the instance above, to
woman's discriminating encouragement, than to anything
else; and, for weal or for woe, hers was
an influence to which he was ever peculiarly sensitive.</p>

<p>The education he received appears to have been
rather desultory. The dry and spiritless mode of conveying
instruction in those days had neither attractions
for his taste, nor power over his mind. As he advanced
into youth, and "macadamised his own road," various
branches of the natural sciences, history, antiquities,
and the fine arts, nearly absorbed his attention. A
course of mathematical study would probably have been
the best discipline for him at this time, as a balance to
the spontaneous development of his imagination. He
afterwards pursued it with great enjoyment, though to
no considerable extent; and, late in life, he proposed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
resumption of the study to the companion of his pursuits&mdash;one
of the many plans so suddenly and so
mournfully cut short.</p>

<p>When he entered on life, and the duties of his profession,
that of a banker, early left him master of many
leisure hours, the use of the pencil was a favourite recreation.
His artistic perceptions must have been very
early developed. He was acquainted with a gentleman
a professed virtuoso, and a collector of those fine old
drawings and sketches which are the first rough thoughts
of the painter, or the playful offspring of his lighter
moments. In an unpublished MS. he thus describes
in the third person his own first introduction to the
beauties of the old masters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A new faculty seemed dawning upon him. He felt
their glorious power exalting, refining, the sense by the
wondrous potency of art; rendering the forms and hues
seen by the imagination visible to the bodily as to the
mental eye; and expressing in a tangible shape what
had before existed only in the hidden recesses of the
soul. He saw for the first time a few of the random
sketches, the first bright thoughts of these great men,
struck out like sparks from the glowing embers of fancy.
The fire and freedom of such rude scratches were
pointed out; and he could see with a painter's eye the
beauty of a line, the combination and the arrangement,
the first shadowy thoughts of the artist emerging from
chaos into form." That he possessed even then, to a
considerable extent, the artist's power as well as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
perception, may be inferred from an anecdote of those
days which forms the conclusion of the passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The professor of <i>vertu</i> was expatiating one day, to
a group of bystanders, on the merits of some little gem
of a drawing he had just purchased. He pointed out
the beauties with great gusto, fully impressing his
auditory with a sense of the profound knowledge and
superiority of his own discrimination. The novice
leaned over, and, young as he was, enjoyed the dissertation
vastly. In a while he ventured to make a remark:
the man of art turned round, and with a look of
contempt, intended to extinguish the youthful aspirant,
said, 'We don't allow you to be a judge, sir.' Abashed,
he shrank back; but the wound rankled, and he determined
to have lusty revenge. He sketched on paper,
with great freedom and carelessness, the subject of an
old etching, imitating as nearly as possible the style he
had previously seen. By the judicious application of
tobacco-juice, soot, bistre, ochre, and a little grease, so
as to make the picture a perfect pattern of dirt,&mdash;a
rent, a puncture, a piecing here and there, to show the
care with which it had been preserved,&mdash;he succeeded
in making, as he thought, a tolerable imitation, and with
great glee gallanted off the prize to his preceptor. The
connoisseur at once pronounced the few bold strokes,
every one of which 'told,' to be those of a master; and
his pupil had much difficulty in evading his inquiries, as
to where he had met with it, and whether there were
any more to be had." His success was complete; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
neither love of triumph, nor gratified vanity, tempted
him to divulge the secret, and thereby mortify his
acquaintance: he was satisfied with the result of the
experiment, nor did he ever after repeat it.</p>

<p>His first attempt at composition was called forth by
a friend, who put into his hand a copy of a periodical
which, at that time, offered prizes for the best essays on
prescribed subjects, to be sent in by young persons
under a specified age. It was suggested to him, that
he should take one of the subjects, and see what he
could make of it. He at first hesitated; but, recalling
the magic power of the little word "<span class="smcap">Try</span>," he sat down
to the task, and composed an essay:&mdash;"To show what
obligations parents and children are under to tutors
and governesses, and how far it is their duty, from
gratitude and interest, to behave towards them with
friendship and respect." It was considered worthy of
the prize, as appears from a copy of Blair's Class-book,&mdash;in
the fly-leaves of which the essay is preserved,&mdash;bearing
in the customary gilt letters the inscription,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"PRESENTED TO MASTER JOHN ROBY, AGED FIFTEEN.<br /></span>
<span class="i7">A REWARD OF MERIT."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now fairly aware of his powers, to the pleasures of
the pencil were added those of the pen. As might be
expected, Poetry, Essay, Tale, were all tried, read at
first to juvenile companions, as extracts he had met
with. Why should early authorship, like early love, be
a thing we shrink from avowing, even to the nearest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
our friends? It is because, when we write truthfully
and earnestly, we lay bare our very soul; and the
avowal in this, as in the other case, becomes an
exposure of one's inner self.</p>

<p>Debating and Philosophical societies ere long attracted
him, and he evidently exerted a leading influence
on his companions. He took a prominent part in
their projects and reunions. "Sucking in knowledge
like a sponge," as he afterwards said, he was as ready
to impart it. A silver snuff-box,&mdash;still prized as a
relic of his eighteenth or nineteenth year,&mdash;bearing the
following inscription,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"THE GIFT OF THE PHILOSOPHIC SOCIETY, WIGAN,<br /></span>
<span class="i9">TO THEIR<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>attests the nature of his early pursuits, and the
estimation in which he was then held by his associates.</p>

<p>The local press was another channel for the exercise
of his talents; and it appears by a letter from the editor
of the "Chester Courant," preserved with other relics of
early days, that some of his contributions to the paper,
during a short residence in that city, attracted the
notice of the London papers, and were copied into their
columns,&mdash;a fact on which the worthy editor rather
prided himself, while he congratulated his unknown
correspondent. From a memorandum book in handwriting
of an early date, containing "Subjects for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Consideration," we transcribe one page to indicate
favourite directions of thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The oxydation of metals, by passing the electric
spark through them.</p>

<p>"The faculty which the eye possesses of accommodating
its focal distance to objects placed at different
distances.</p>

<p>"The sound which proceeds from the shock of the
particles of the air, against those of water in motion.
Vide Thomson's Ann. Phil. p. 187.</p>

<p>"Fresh-discovered property of the syphon."</p>

<p>He had now found, in part at least, that companionship
and sympathy for which he had so earnestly longed,
and his spirit gave itself up to delighted converse with
its fellows, and to the pursuits of literature and art:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All the glowing future, one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide atmosphere of light."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His preference even from childhood of cultivated
female society, while his reverence for woman and his
standard of her excellence were equally high, also contributed
to keep the tone of his mind pure and his life
stainless. The dawn of existence thus brightened into
the full morning of youth: and if those who now fondly
look back upon him with affection and pride, may bless
<span class="smcap">God</span> for such a youth, it is owing, under His blessing,
to the love of art, knowledge, and woman's intelligent
society.</p>

<p>Yet his own estimate of his character at that period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
should not be lost sight of. When referring to this
time, in terms of thankfulness for having been kept
from outward evil, he ever owned that as yet he was
without the guidance of the true Christian principle&mdash;love
to <span class="smcap">God</span>; "that 'the light of the glorious Gospel,'
which alone is the true 'lamp unto our path,' had not
yet shone into his spirit. <i>He lived only to himself</i>; and
though, soaring through natural bias to loftier pursuits,
thus kept from the grovelling propensities of youth, yet,
in a religious point of view, <i>his heart</i> was, equally with
that of others, the barren wilderness, <i>destitute of fruit to
the glory of Him who created it</i>, and who demands our
'heart, and soul, and strength,' in His service." So
judged a mature self-knowledge, on looking back to the
first years of manhood. Were introspection always as
faithful, might not the same conclusion be oftener
reached?</p>

<p>Hitherto the little bark had sped with no cross wind,
no disturbing current, no shadow on her sail. Love
came: still life's glad waters were unruffled&mdash;all sunshine
and repose. But the storm soon gathered, and
life's first romance was destined to close in gloom. It
will be readily supposed, that, with the impassioned
temperament of genius, he gave himself up without
reserve to the power of a <i>first-love</i>; and, with the
adhesiveness which Phrenology so largely assigned to
him, the permanence of his attachment promised to
equal its intensity. For a time, "the course of true
love," <i>did</i> "run smooth;" but at length a coldness he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
could not account for, but which had for some time
pained him, led on his part to remonstrance. It was
resented, and the interview ended in mutual displeasure.
Riding home,&mdash;not in the happiest mood,&mdash;his horse
stumbled and threw him. For a few days he lay,
unable to travel, in a house near the spot where he had
been thrown. Humbler and wiser thoughts prevailed;
and the first use he made of his recovered power of
moving, was to return and seek another interview.
Reconciliation followed, and he left happy and reassured.
But, the evening after his arrival at home, a
short, cold, and haughty epistle, brought him by private
hand, forbade his future visits. Stung to the quick by
what appeared heartlessness, if not duplicity, he resolved
to forget his idol for ever; and looked around for a
worthier object in whose affection he might lose his
sense of injury and regret. It was not till his faith was
plighted to another that he discovered the <i>undated</i>
note was written previously to his last visit, shortly
after their angry parting, but owing to his absence from
home not sooner delivered. Honour forbade any
allusion to this circumstance to the object of the second
attachment, to whom he considered himself sacredly
engaged, but the blow struck home. A severe illness,
during which his life was despaired of, supervened; and,
though an elastic nature recovered, it still retained
traces of this "maddening misery." More than thirty
years afterwards he could not refer to these passages
of his history without a shudder, and intense, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
controlled, feeling. Some peculiarities referable to this
source remained through life. Henceforth a discord
ran through all the melodies of existence, and ever and
anon reproduced itself in the creations of imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. Roby first appeared before the world as a poet.
In 1815 he published "Sir Bertram, a poem in six
cantos." Elegant and melodious versification, exquisite
word-painting, and a marked tendency to the use of the
supernatural, are its chief characteristics. Though not
published before, there is every reason to believe it was
composed some time previously, during the happy
season of hopeful, if not formally requited, love. Here
are no traces to be found of that one sorrow. It was
the pouring forth of song from a poetic spirit, that as
yet knew not the power of the minor key. Another
poem quickly followed, entitled "Lorenzo, a tale of
Redemption." It met with a limited sale: the versification
was heavy, unlike anything else he ever wrote,
and the subject was unsuited to his powers. The now
venerable poet Montgomery, who had just published
his own "Greenland," gave the young author the
benefit of his judicious criticism, a kindness difficult to
perform; but, judging by a letter from him of the date
of July, 1817, he knew well how to combine candour and
courtesy. The subsequent productions of his disciple
proved that his valuable suggestions were not thrown
away.</p>

<p>In 1816 Mr. Roby married Ann, the youngest
daughter of James and Dorothy Bealey, of Derrikens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
near Blackburn. Of her many excellencies he ever
spoke in the highest terms, and she must have been,
from the testimony of all who had the pleasure of
knowing her, as well as from that of her husband, one
of the best and gentlest of women, the most affectionate
and anxious of mothers. They had nine children, three
of whom died in their infancy.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Mantua," a tragedy, which appeared
in 1823, was Mr. Roby's next publication. It went
through three or four editions in a short time, and was
pronounced by the critics, "worthy of a place among
our best closet plays." It has been long out of print,
and is included in the present volume.</p>

<p>In the course of the summer, he made an excursion
in Scotland. He visited "the bonnie braes of
Yarrow," in company with Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd.
His account of the day so pleasantly spent, is a
good specimen of his early prose style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I went with Hogg the other morning on a '<i>Voyage
pittoresque</i>' up the Yarrow. It was a delicious Claude-looking
day&mdash;the sky filled with a warm hazy brightness.
Every cloud stole as softly up the firmament, as if some
creature 'of the immaterial air' melting into the blue ether.
None of those sudden lights&mdash;those breaks through a hard
and almost impenetrable pile of clouds&mdash;an Apennine or Andes
poised in the middle air, dividing the landscape into vast
enclosures&mdash;masses of shadow, deep, awful, and abrupt&mdash;or
moving patches, of a wild and unnatural brightness.</p>

<p>"We set out from Selkirk pretty early, intending to
reach St. Mary's before noon. We loitered lazily up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
stream, imbibing the keen freshness of the morning. The
mists were just rolling from the green hills, when, on
passing the bridge, we turned to our left, entering upon the
beautiful road, leading through the Duke of Buccleugh's
grounds, to Altrieve and St. Mary's Loch. The Yarrow and
the Ettrick unite about two miles above Selkirk. Following
the course of the former, we soon spied the ruins of Newark
Castle, the scene of Sir Walter's 'Lay of the Last Minstrel.'
It is a massive square tower, now unroofed, surrounded by
an outward wall, and defended by round flanking turrets.
During the minority of the present Duke, the castle was
dilapidated; the wooden beams, and such stones as could
be removed, were employed in building a miserable farm-house
in its vicinity.</p>

<p>"I felt wishful to obtain a closer inspection of this fine
old specimen of border antiquity; more especially on learning
that Mungo Park&mdash;born at Foulshiels, a small farm within
a stone's throw of the castle&mdash;had left his autograph somewhere
within its walls. We soon procured admittance, and
on climbing the ruined staircase, entered a large roofless
apartment on the second story, where, sure enough, we
found, without much trouble, the name of our enterprising,
but unfortunate, countryman, written, two or three times, in
a large clerk-like hand with <i>red chalk</i>. Hogg seemed as
well pleased as if he had found a 'poss,' and rummaged his
galligaskins for a hideous bit of scrawl, that he had several
times brought forth from its dark den, during our journey,
when any thing particularly inspiring had urged its momentary
liberation. A poem perhaps, another exquisite 'Kilmeny'
or 'Mary Lee' in embryo, undergoing its appointed
period of incubation. I made no inquiries, but continued
undisturbed in the great business of exploration. In a
short time I heard him bundling down the steps, to take a
morning's gossip with the keeper. It was not long ere I
found myself amply repaid for any sense of deprivation I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
might have endured, by discovering another flourish with
the identical red chalk, and evidently by the same hand.
It was a stanza&mdash;four lines of poetry by Mungo Park!&mdash;If
thou hast any touch of feeling&mdash;any mark of kindred&mdash;any
spark of rarer sympathy&mdash;imagine, if thou canst, my
delight,&mdash;the fervour, the intensity of my rapture. They
fixed indelibly, and almost involuntarily on my memory;&mdash;there
they now exist, and probably will continue until every
faculty, every function, be obliterated.</p>

<p>"The following is a true copy, spelling and all. The
orthography of poor Park was not of the purest kind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Within these walls where obscene birds of night<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whistle and shriek alternate round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft music <i>floted</i> once, whilst with delight<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The distant shepherd caught the dying sound.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I do not think they show marks of quotation. I hope
and believe they are original; at least, I am pretty certain
they have not before been noticed.</p>

<p>"I soon roused the skulkers: a vigorous hurrah was the
first intimation they had of the enemy being so near their
camp. Bang went the first door I came to, and there I
found my friend and his, cantie over a cup of the best
mountain, and deep in the heart of a thrifty controversy
about sheep, their ailments and cures. It was 'an awfu
downcome; they stared at each other without perfectly understanding
the nature of my announcement. On a repetition,
'Eh, Mr. Bogle, but ye're gone clean blate,' was the
rejoinder, 'Ha' ye seen a ghaist!' With some difficulty I
made them reluctantly comprehend two very important
matters, to wit, my meaning, and a request that they would
give me their sweet company awhile. But how they did
shout, and rub their sleeves at the discovery; we looked as
funny at one another as three ambassadors at a congress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
It was as good as the development of a state secret. The
best of it is, that it will be a little fortune to the keeper,
and a dowry to his weans. Henceforth pilgrimages will
be made to the shrine, vieing with Loch Katrine and the
pass of Aberfoil in the number of its votaries and the
ardour of its worshippers.</p>

<p>"We bade good bye to Newark, and awa' up the braes o'
Yarrow, shouting and laughing with the wild echoes of the
flood, to the great dismay of sundry bare-legged Naiads and
goddesses, peeping ever and anon through 'covert green and
woodland dell.'</p>

<p>"My companion had to make a call at his tailor's, who
inhabits the low house nigh to the Ford.&mdash;A very strange
personage this, but of an infinite humour, and pomposity of
demeanor.</p>

<p>"It was the very man whom Blackwood accused in one
of his 'magi,' of regularly buying two copies of that work,
and reading both, from beginning to end, imagining them
to be diverse and distinct from each other. He was
mightily affronted at this insinuation, and duly wrote, and
concocted a letter;&mdash;such a curiosity as was never before
seen, since the world whistled. I recollect being indulged
with a sight of it in the 'back-shop.' He utterly disclaimed
taking two copies of the magazine, under any such erroneous
impression. The true reason was, that wife and bairns had
such an 'ettling for the beuk' that he had no comfort on
the occasion, and was often obliged to run for it&mdash;to creep
behind a stone dike or into a hedge bottom, in the hope of
getting free from their importunities, and even then he was
in no wise safe from interruption,&mdash;some kind neighbour
or another would scent him out, and be 'aye licken his
fingers frae the dish.' Taking two copies set all to rights,
and each party enjoyed their meal in peace. He was dreadfully
puzzled about the different 'Hor&aelig;' scattered through
the numbers, and consulted the minister about their reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to certain matters then abroad, but to which he thought
no decent respectable publication, like Blackwood, should
have alluded.</p>

<p>"We journeyed on to Altrieve, where Hogg has a quiet
domicile within sight of St. Mary's banks, and Dryhope
tower, where 'the flower of Yarrow lived and died.' It
was high dinner hour when we arrived. A hearty welcome&mdash;a
dish of boiled trout fresh from the Lake, and et ceteras
<i>ad lib.</i>, gave a <i>gout</i> and a relish to the succeeding conceptions
and concoctions, over which Mrs. Hogg presided,&mdash;while
the exhilarating influence of high animal spirits, and
a 'wee drappie' of the elixir of the mountain, threw a vivid
hue and a glowing atmosphere around every theme on which
we dilated.</p>

<p>"Hogg is a kind-hearted creature, a man of the rarest
genius, compounded out of the most heterogeneous elements,
as if nature in one of her freaks had determined to evince
the omnipotence of her power, over the most untractable,
and unpromising materials,&mdash;to mould even the stubborn,
and unyielding forms over which she broods, into combinations
of the most exquisite symmetry, and delicacy of
texture.</p>

<p>"I reckon Hogg's achievements on a par with the most
wonderful records of human capability extant. A shepherd's
boy, as uncouth and ungifted as any of his tribe&mdash;apparently
without a glimmer, or an idea of the beautiful or sublime, any
further than as it might have relation to a dry bed and a
comfortable meal&mdash;scarcely able to write his name at a very
advanced period of growth. Now he blazes forth, a bright
intelligence amongst the lights of the age. Really his works
deserve to form part and parcel of our national literature,
at once a monument to his glory and an inextinguishable
record of the operations of that genius, who setteth no
bounds to her habitation, nor suffereth control."</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The literary leisure of the next six years was occupied
in collecting materials for the Traditions of Lancashire,
and by the creative power of imagination, weaving
them into tales of romantic interest. Mr. Roby received
the most courteous assistance from several of the representatives
of the noble houses, whose early history
he elucidated; particularly from the Earl and late
Countess of Crawford and Balcarres, and also from the
late Earl of Derby (1853).</p>

<p>The commencement of the year 1827 was marked by
one of those home events, which, though nothing to the
world, make sad change in the fire-side circle. Mr.
Roby's second boy, named after his brother, the late Rev.
William Roby, of Manchester, was at this time about
three years of age. Possessed of unusual loveliness and
remarkable sensibility for so young a child, he had won
upon his parents' hearts, and on that of his father to a
remarkable degree. The moment he entered the house,
he would call for his darling boy, and place him on his
knee at the piano, while the little listener, if not interrupted,
would remain for hours rapt in delight. He
could not be happy while the child was out of his sight.
After a very brief illness, this beautiful boy was called
away from the world. His father's heart was wrung,
long did he mourn him; and he never dared again to
love a child with such idolatry. An infant, a few
months' old, had before been laid in the family grave,
and on the stone covering their remains, Mr. Roby had
the following lines engraven:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Farewell sweet babes! Upon a mother's breast<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ye pass'd life's hour of fretfulness and pain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death bids you on his colder bosom rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Herald of bliss;&mdash;unutterable gain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His touch was life!&mdash;in robes of triumph drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sinless and spotless now&mdash;a Saviour's death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fountain opened&mdash;washed from every stain<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Each spirit, ere its last faint quivering breath&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As o'er its eyeballs burst eternal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Left its first cherub smile to linger on its clay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A third infant was laid beside them in 1832, and there
now repose <i>his own</i> loved and most precious remains,
and to these last, as to those for whom they were
originally intended, may the closing lines be applied.
The smile last seen on that beloved face is one with which
it may well awake on the morning of the resurrection.</p>

<p>Mr. Roby visited the English Lakes that year. A
manuscript book of notes and sketches remains, and
both pen and pencil attest the quickness and correctness
of the observer. On ordinary objects he looked with
an eye practised in gaining general information, and on
Nature with that of the artist. In looking over the
sketches one cannot but remark how very little change
years have made in that district. Not only the majestic
objects of Nature, the accessories of man's placing also,
stood then precisely as they do now. The Druid's
Circle near Keswick seems the only exception; the
fir trees which then waved their dark branches above
the grey stones are gone. Grange, reposing at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of Borrowdale, with its beautiful bridge, dark clear
stream, and everlasting mountains a close back-ground.
The Bowder stone<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>, its ladder and cottage, and the
sharply-defined perpendicular strata rising above all,
are unchanged. The sketches of a quarter of a century
ago might be those of last year. The very buildings
seem identically the same in every part. Nature
stamped them picturesque as they were set down in her
sacred recesses, and they have not dared to throw off
the spell. A few extracts from the note-book will
exemplify the style of observation. The aspect of the
district; the manners of its inhabitants; individual
peculiarities whatever of men or things; natural productions,
and above all, the ever-varying forms of
beauty, with which nature in such a region clothes
herself,&mdash;none of these escaped his observant and
admiring eye.</p>

<p>Grasmere was at that time the abode of the gifted and
excentric Hartley Coleridge. He was standing at Jonathan's
door when the tourists drove up. They soon made acquaintance
with him, and it was not long ere they were deep in
discussion on the subject of Kant's Philosophy, the Rosicrucian
System, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The repose of Grasmere; pleasures of retirement. No
pleasure but to those who possess an innate repose and a
mind full of susceptibilities for these beautiful impressions.
The bold dragoon and his wife, who took a house here
about three months since, for seven years,&mdash;are now heartily
tired of it. Confounding of phrases&mdash;to say a man <i>is</i> a
genius, great mistake&mdash;rather say a man <i>has</i> genius, or
rather genius has <i>him</i>. Often disappointed in our approach
to 'reputed geniuses.' A clever man not always a man of
genius. Idiom and dialect diffused over a man's very form
and face, habits, and character. Tone of voice acquired by
contact. Strong voices of the females generally in the north.
Quite a literary air about Grasmere. Proof sheets lying
about the public-house. Hartley Coleridge engaged in
writing the article 'Poetry' in the 'Encyclopedia Metropolitana.'"
The notice of Grasmere concludes with a then unpublished

<p>The first series of the Traditions of Lancashire appeared
in 1829, in two volumes, illustrated by plates
engraved by Finden, from drawings by Pickering; and
wood-cuts by Williams, after designs by Frank Howard.
The matter, the embellishments, and the spirited publishers,
Messrs Longman and Co., were alike worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
each other. The reception of the work equalled
Mr. Roby's most sanguine expectations; for though the
price, demy 8vo., 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>, royal 8vo., with proofs and
etchings, 4<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>, made it rather a book for a gentleman's
library than for general circulation, a second edition was
called for within twelve months. The following note
from Sir Francis Palgrave, no incompetent judge, was
a gratifying estimate of the work as forming part of our
national literature:&mdash;</p>

<p>The second series, consisting also of two volumes,
uniform with the first, was published in 1831, and met
with similar success. Both series were reviewed in the
most cordial manner by the leading periodicals of the
day; more than once quoted, and characterized by Sir
Walter Scott, himself a host, as an elegant work. (<i>See
Introduction to the Betrothed.</i>)</p>

<p>When composing, Mr. Roby usually wrote with his
family around him; the only restraint he laid upon
them, was the prohibition of whispering; from conversation
carried on in the ordinary tone he could
wholly abstract himself. Seated in a favourite rocking-chair,
that common northern luxury, wrapped in a loose
study-gown, he wrote for hours with rapidity and
pleasure. When invention flagged, and he had to seek
an idea, he would fold his arms, and gently rock for a
few minutes, then with the air of a person who had
found what he sought, return to the page with renewed
spirit. Though undisturbed by familiar sounds, which,
indeed, he appeared not to perceive, so completely was
he absorbed in his ideal world, he yet required all
things in order around him before he commenced;
objects indiscriminately scattered conveying disturbance
through the eye, or even an open door, would so
effectually dissipate his thoughts, as to prevent him
from writing. His practice was to make himself master
of the historical ground-work of the tale, and as far as
possible of the manners and customs of the period, and
then to commence composition, with Fosbroke's "Encyclopedia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of Antiquities" at hand, for accuracy of
costume, &amp;c. He always gave the credit of his style,
which the Westminster Review termed "a very model
of good Saxon," to his native country, the force and
energy of whose dialect arises mainly from the prevalence
of the Teutonic element. "The thought digs out the
word," was a favourite saying, when the exact expression
he wanted did not at once occur. To his fine ear for
musical sound he was much indebted for the flowing
ease of his diction.</p>

<p>Though constituting what is denominated light
literature, much careful research was required in the
composition of the tales. The aspect of the country
in those distant times, the costume and customs of the
day, were particulars in which he was scrupulously
exact. To secure this truthfulness of detail, long
investigations were often needed, even where perhaps
they would be little suspected: but always confident
that he should succeed at last, he spared no pains in
ascertaining the most minute particular, and this very
persuasion of success contributed to secure it. By some
means or other he invariably commanded the information
in due time. Amusing instances of this sometimes
occurred. Once, when out of the reach of any work of
reference, he was completely at fault for the blazonry
of a particular banner, used five hundred years ago.
He did not despair, but left the matter in blank,
expecting&mdash;though he would have been puzzled to
tell whence&mdash;the wished-for information would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
forthcoming. And so it was: casually looking at a
review, it so happened that the very thing he wanted
was described with more than ordinary minuteness.</p>

<p>His inexhaustible creative power is conspicuous;
about two hundred different characters are introduced,
no one of whom reminds the reader of another, nor is
invention wanting for abundant diversity of incident
and adventure, heroic and comic. A gentleman who
had been reading the Traditions for the first time,
recently remarked, that for invention he scarcely knew
any writer Mr. Roby's equal. It is perhaps worthy of
notice, that all the characters are creations, not one an
idealized portrait.</p>

<p>Another charm is the fine mould in which his heroines
are cast. There is a delicacy, a nobility, or high-minded
spirit of self-sacrifice about the more prominent, which,
while leaving the characters perfectly distinct, sustains
throughout a high ideal of woman. Not one bad
character figures as a woman; the only approach to
such is in tales of witchcraft, where, indeed, the Arch
Evil One, rather than his poor victim, is the criminal,
as though he would not even bring the idea of evil
athwart the favourite vision of his imagination. It may
be deemed not adhering to nature, thus to omit an
object she, alas! too often presents; but who would
blame the artist for the faultless beauty of his creations?
The sculptor may display his skill, by representing the
contortions of deformity, but not his highest ideal;
may show how clever a copyist with the chisel he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
be, but not how deeply he has drunk of the inspiration
common to all art, how near he has approached to the
Fountain of all Beauty. The clearness of his conceptions,
and the way in which he threw himself into his
characters, are evinced by the dramatic action of even
the shortest story. While writing he appeared actually
to feel as he would have done, had he been in the
situations he described; he felt the perplexity, the
sense of danger, and the exultation of escape; for the
time he seemed to have a double life, at once sharing
the existence of his hero, and sympathizing as a spectator.
It was in a tone that he would have used, had
she been a living being, that he said of one of his
heroines, under very peculiar circumstances of danger<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>,
"<i>I could not</i> let her perish." His plan was to commence
his tale, bring his characters into strange or perilous
situations, realize their danger in its full extent, without
the slightest idea of how he should extricate them; and
then, when the means of escape presented themselves to
his imagination, he would work on, delighted with the
suggestion, till to his great regret the tale was finished.
He knew when to leave off, but it cost him something
to do so; it was like parting company with friends.</p>

<p>The short vivid descriptions of scenery scattered
throughout, are not often equalled. By a few strokes
of the pen, not only a perfect picture of the permanent
objects of a locality is placed before the reader's eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
but also the temporary lights and shadows which are
thrown on the landscape by the ever-shifting skies; the
very feeling of the air does not escape him. Each tale
is in fact a cabinet picture, combining history and landscape.
In the foreground the traditionary group appears
in vivid action; beyond, a far-receding distance, faint in
the noon-tide haze, or perchance a wood, with its broad
shadows, and burst of sunlight across the next glade.
An artist might paint from his descriptions. In the
case of one of the most effective engravings, that of
Rivington Pike, the drawing was made after the artist
had read the tale; the accessories of light and shade,
and in the original, of colour also, doubtless owe something
of their character to this circumstance.</p>

<p>In his power of depicting the supernatural, Mr. Roby
stands pre-eminent; and this not only in little weird
touches, that come upon the reader he knows not how,
waking a chord within which makes him feel that
he has kindred with mysteries more than the eye sees,
or the ear hears&mdash;but in long-sustained intercourse
with beings who people the unseen world, and who seem
at certain times, and in certain places, to press upon
mortal spirits even to recognition, more, even to hallowed
or unhallowed communion. As if there were,
time and space concurring, points of juncture for the
two worlds. The ease with which he carries his reader
along with him, even in spite of the anti-spiritual
prejudices of the present age, cannot be better exemplified
than in the tale to which reference has just been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
made, Rivington Pike, which has been said by a German
reviewer to be, "the only authentic tale of demoniacal
possession the English have." The composition
of the story had a powerful effect on the writer himself.
He sat up writing longer than usual after the rest of the
family had retired. It was midnight when he had
finished; and so completely had the scenes he had been
describing, taken possession of his own mind, that he
dared not stir from his seat, nor did he, till Mrs. Roby,
surprised at his remaining down stairs so long after his
accustomed time, entered the room; the sight of a
familiar face broke the spell, and dissipated the visionary
alarm.</p>

<p>The purity of the morality is such as befits a Christian
writer, and there is throughout the work a spirit of
reverence for things sacred, and of deference to the
supreme source of illumination, which is not always
to be found in our lighter literature. The reader,
charmed and delighted, is carried away from ordinary
scenes into a world of romance. Nevertheless in that
ideal land he finds the same laws of morality which
govern his daily life&mdash;the same God looked up to, as
the disposer of all things, the Father at once to be loved
and obeyed; and he may go back to his duties in common
life, without one moral idea having been deranged,
or one principle disturbed.</p>

<p>It was at one time Mr. Roby's intention to follow up
the "Traditions of Lancashire" with similar illustrations
of the early history of the county of York. Subjects
were chosen, and a few tales written, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
appeared in Blackwood's and Frazer's magazines. One,
though not of this series, which was published in Frazer,
February 1837, under the title of "The Smuggler's
Daughter," was proposed to be dramatised. The parts
were cast, Mrs. Yates or Mrs. Keeley was to have taken
that of the heroine, and Mr. Buckstone and Mr. O. Smith
were to have engaged in others. From the correspondence
on the subject, it appears that Mr. Buckstone's
attention being demanded by other and rather perplexing
affairs, the representation of the "Smuggler's Daughter"
was delayed till after the appearance of the story
in the Magazine, and at last suffered to fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>A book containing sketches of the different localities
he intended to illustrate, and memoranda of the traditions
attached to them, made during excursions into Yorkshire
for this purpose, show the spirit with which he
entered on his task, and it is much to be regretted that
anything should have been allowed to set it aside.
About this time he commenced the study of botany in
good earnest. In the same book are notes of a first
botanical tour, a few extracts from which may not be
uninteresting: they are certainly characteristic. While
pursuing the details of science, he was in no danger of
falling under the poet's malediction on him,</p>

<p>In the spring of 1837, Mr. Roby made a rapid tour
on the Continent, the notes and illustrative sketches
of which were published in two volumes by Messrs.
Longman and Co., under the title of "Seven Weeks
in Belgium, Switzerland, Lombardy, Piedmont, Savoy,
&amp;c." His quickness, and clearness of observation, and
power of placing before the reader's eye, in a few words,
the objects which met his own, render the book delightful
and refreshing to those whom duty detains at home.
Notes were taken on the spot, and but slightly amplified,
so that the narrative has all the freshness of a youthful
description of a day's pleasure. If the road branches off
in two directions, and the driver hardly knows which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to take, the reader himself feels puzzled, and thinks
with apprehension of the nearness of the sun to the
horizon, and the miles yet to be traversed; if the
traveller is sailing down the lake listlessly drinking in
the beauty around him, the reader, too, feels the calm
repose of the still expanse of waters, and the softened
grandeur of the panorama of mountains. Even "the
dry hard names" of rare plants&mdash;music to the botanist&mdash;followed
as they are here by their more familiar
synonyms, enhance the charm of the book: we look up
from the sunny surface of the glacier to the crimson
flowers of the <i>Azalea procumbens</i> (trailing Azalea)
starring the barren rock. Graphic description alternates
with personal adventure and amusing anecdote,
marked alike by vivacity of style, and the buoyant spirit
of the author. Charming as a narrative of continental
travel, it at the same time has been said, "as a guide
book to the continent," to be "the best that was ever
written,"&mdash;the sight-seer, the lover of scenery, and the
botanist may use it to equal advantage. It shows how
much may be secured by a really active and inquisitive
mind, in a few weeks, while the full particulars respecting
passports, routes, distances, moneys, exchanges, &amp;c.,
puts the reader in the way of enjoying as much himself,
when it falls to his lot to take the same route. The
pictures of nature are in Mr. Roby's own effective style.
The start from the Custom-house, termed by the
"Literary Gazette" "a Calcott picture in a few lines," is
an instance. "It was a calm grey morning, the population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
were hardly astir, the river with its wilderness of
masts seemed hardly awake; and the very water having
been suffered to rest untroubled for a space, looked dull
and drowsy." The impressions made by the first sight
of Alpine scenery on a mind like his, are, as it may be
expected, vividly told. It was of this part of the work,
that a lady, who had been familiar with good English
scenery all her life, and did justice to it both by pen and
pencil, remarked, "That book taught me to look at
mountains."</p>

<p>In 1840 Mr. Roby again visited the Continent by a
different route, adhering to his custom of making notes
and sketches of what he saw. At the close of the same
year his attention was engaged by the preparation of a
new edition of the "Traditions of Lancashire," in a less
expensive form, so as to bring it within the reach of
general readers. It was published in three volumes by
Colburn, as the first of a series of Popular Traditions of
England.</p>

<p>Mr. Roby's delight was as great in imparting as in
imbibing knowledge, and he took a warm interest in all
institutions for its diffusion. The principal literary occupation
of the next four years appears to have been the
preparation and delivery of lectures in connexion with
societies of this kind, in which his native county so
eminently abounds. His early efforts, while yet residing
at Wigan, and the welcome reception they met
with, have been before noticed; quite as acceptable
were the matured results of reading and research now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
offered to larger and more mixed audiences. In the
early autumn of 1838 he gave a course of ten lectures
in the theatre, Rochdale, in aid of the Philosophic and
Literary Society of that town, on botany; comprising
both classification and physiology, illustrated by large
diagrams painted in distemper. They were afterwards
delivered at Manchester, accompanied by some
beautiful experiments, made with the aid of Dr. Warwick's
oxy-hydrogen microscope, kindly superintended
by that gentleman, and subsequently at the Collegiate
Institution, Liverpool.</p>

<p>The subjects of other lectures were various. A course
of four, on Tradition, as connected with, and illustrating
history, antiquities, and Romance, were delivered at
Rochdale. Drawings executed in a bold style in black
and red chalks, many of them thrown off at the time,
illustrated either the localities where the various legends
had birth, or the costumes, style of building, &amp;c. of the
period. One set of lectures which the writer has been
so happy as to find fully written out, manifests not only
his taste for art, but his knowledge of its principles.
They are on painting, embracing light and shade, composition,
colour, and perspective; and when delivered,
were copiously illustrated, occasionally by pictures of
the old masters in his possession. He was never more
at home, than when ministering to the instruction or
gratification of others. His talents, information, acquisitions
of various kinds, whatever he might happen to
possess, that could at all contribute to the purpose, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
put in requisition; and when the idea he wished to
convey, or illustrate, was caught by his audience, or in
private by his listening friends, his countenance became
radiant with pleasure; the belief that he had been of
use in any way to others, was one of his highest gratifications.</p>

<p>Among his MSS. are some lectures on architecture,
commencing with the rude huts of barbarous tribes, and
then proceeding to the structures, as far as they are
known, of the ancient nations. Gothic architecture
finds its place in the fifth lecture; but from the abruptness
with which it breaks off in the middle of a sentence,
it appears that the lectures were not completed. There
are also, memoranda and rough diagrams for distinct
lectures on baronial architecture.</p>

<p>A friend of Mr. Roby's, who was also for many years
a neighbour, has kindly favoured the writer with the
following recollections of some of his lectures.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The cheerful alacrity with which on several occasions
Mr. Roby yielded to the solicitations of his fellow-townsmen,
by giving gratuitous lectures to assist their Institution, was
evidence of his often-expressed wish to raise his less fortunate
countrymen in the scale of intellectual and social life.
I often came in contact with him in connexion with the
Rochdale Literary and Philosophic Society, for which he gave
several lectures on Tradition, Botany, and some other subjects.
His lectures on the Linn&aelig;an system of Botany, and
another series on the Physiology of Plants, given before our
society, were of the very first character; displaying an
amount of research, and a power of analysis, combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
most felicitous modes of illustration, rarely meeting in the
same individual. The colored drawings used on these occasions,
executed by himself and his son, would have done honour
to any artist. Such was the popularity of the two botanical
courses, that, by request, they were repeated in Manchester,
and some other neighbouring towns. In illustrating
the lectures on Tradition, the rapidity with which he could
throw off the gable or window of an old manor-house or any
object of a similar character, was, to me, perfectly marvellous&mdash;a
few touches, and the effect was produced."</p></div>

<p>The most popular of the lectures were those on the
peculiarities of the Lancashire dialect. They were delivered
to crowded audiences at several literary institutions,
connected with different large towns in the county.
In a tolerably full abstract, given by the "Preston Pilot,"
and in the original notes, there is ample proof of the
highly interesting character of these lectures. Ethnological
inquiries, full of attraction to the lovers of that
science, formed the introduction, while, to a Lancashire
audience, the charm of the whole must have been
irresistible, and have furnished an entertainment second
only to "Mathews at Home." The fund of anecdote,
the rich racy humour which sparkled through the
lecture, the inimitable wit of "Tummus and Meary,"
and the equally inimitable tones of the voice which then
gave it utterance, are still fresh in the recollection of
many. Had the lectures been fully written out, they

indicated in the notes by the principal word or sentence,
and go far to prove what the lecturer asserted, that a
Lancashire man would at any time equal an Irishman
in wit.</p>

<p>These lectures were last delivered at Preston, in
March, 1844. Having commenced the series, Mr. Roby,
with characteristic determination, persisted in carrying
it through, though suffering from a severe attack of
influenza, which he kept at bay by force of will. Immediately
on his return home his health gave way.
Mischief had been going on for years, but the activity
of his mind, and that indomitable spirit, which would
bear extreme suffering before it complained, even to
itself, had prevented his heeding any indications of
disease, till it had pervaded the whole system. The
disorder baffled medical skill; change of scene was
tried in vain: as months rolled on his sufferings increased;
and, though still striving to attend to professional
duties, he was utterly unfit to cope with care
and anxiety of any kind. Physical pain rendered him
incapable of deriving pleasure from any of those sources
which had heretofore afforded such rich enjoyment.
Society, art, intellectual pursuits, became not only
insipid but distasteful, and with this suffering a new
element mingled, deep mental distress. Holy Writ
speaks of such a thing as the heart not being "right in
the sight of God," and a fearful consciousness that such
was his own case, now became as "the arrow of the
Almighty, the poison whereof drinketh up the spirit."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
An increasingly vivid apprehension of the just claims
of the Being who demands of His creatures, the
love of "heart and mind, and soul, and strength," a
deepening insight into his own nature, augmented the
torturing sense of his own deficiency. In a life without
reproach, spent in the discharge of duty, and in refined
and ennobling pursuits, there was nothing on which
self-observation, while it looked at the outward, could
detect a stain. Life had hitherto been too busy, time
too fully and pleasantly occupied, to afford leisure for
self-inspection; but now the ordinary routine of pursuit
had been broken, and involuntary retirement induced;
the eye was turned within, and the result was a conviction
that <span class="smcap">God</span> had not thus been loved with heart,
and soul, and strength; and the spirit which had so long
been partially under the power of great principles, now
awoke to feel that it must incorporate them with its
very life&mdash;or die. Little wonder that, on a spirit whose
sensibilities were at once quick and strong, and on
whom impressions once made were singularly permanent,
such discoveries should work agony so intense, or that
those who understood not the cause of the distress,
should think that reason herself was giving way. Such
has often been said of others, who were passing through
the same crisis of their mental history, not inaptly
termed "the everlasting No!" His mind had too much
play to lose its balance. A more stolid mind, or a brain
like "the gentle" Cowper's, predisposed to malady,
would in all probability have given way, as month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
after month, year after year, rolled away and brought
no relief. It was a suffering no friends could soothe;
his mental conformation peculiar,&mdash;none seemed to meet
its emergencies. Bodily disease no doubt aggravated
mental agony, but as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No wounds like those a wounded spirit feels"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No cure for such, till <span class="smcap">God</span> who makes them heals."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a long time the only relief of which his mind was
susceptible, arose from his acquaintance with one in
some respects similar to his own, one which understood
his sufferings perfectly, for it had known the same both
in kind and in degree. The moral element in each,
which recoiled from the divine requirements, must have
taken precisely the same form of action. Beautiful,
even from the very contrasts it presented, was the true
and faithful friendship that ensued, between minds
sympathising in one point of overpowering interest,
though in training and pursuits widely dissimilar; and
warm was the gratitude with which he ever held in
remembrance those unwearied efforts to pour consolation
into his tortured spirit.</p>

<p>To trace the mental history for three or four years,
from the commencement of the illness, would be too
painful, even were the subject not too sacred. Increasing
physical disease, wearing trial of other kinds,
asked for a spirit vigorous and happy in the Christian's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
strength, to bear up against them; but instead of that
the mind had at the same time woes of its own to
sustain. Left to feel as it had never before felt, its
own inwrought sinfulness and utter helplessness, it was
borne down, crushed, only rising again to suffer anew,
and again to sink. If the promises of <span class="smcap">God</span> shone out
as the stars in a cloudy night, it was only a momentary
gleam, and dense darkness covered the face of heaven
as before. Most touching are some private papers and
letters, written during this period. In the former,
particularly, intense yearning for the consciousness of a
personal share in the Saviour's love, earnest longings to
be able with appropriating faith to say "<i>My</i> Father,"
are expressed with an emphasis, that renders them an
embodiment of mental suffering in all its reality and
severity. Afterwards, when the time of trial was past,
and he could look back on it and trace its effects, he
frequently remarked, that he believed no other than the
severe discipline he then underwent, could have brought
a spirit like his to entire self-renunciation. Cant or
religious pretence was alike repugnant to his nature,
and to his cultivated taste; but in those days of suffering
he gained such insight into himself, as led him, pure
as his outward life had been, fully to appropriate the
strongest expressions, by which the scriptures indicate
the sinfulness of human nature. He then recognised
in this period of mental conflict and distress, the direct
acting of the Spirit of <span class="smcap">God</span>, revealing those things
which "the natural man knoweth not." What were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
dimly apprehended before, as little more than objects of
intellectual belief&mdash;the extent of the moral derangement
of his own nature, the mystery of personal connexion
with the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;had
now become matters of cordial faith. Thus, raised by
His power into a full participation of those things, only
to be understood by such participation, his became a
new existence. The secret spring of daily actions was
changed. Never living entirely without the <i>fear</i> of
<span class="smcap">God</span> as a <i>controlling</i> principle, he now became sensible
of <i>love</i> to Him as an <i>impelling</i> principle, causing him to
seek to serve Him to whom he owed so much, and
to follow His will in all the pursuits of life.</p>

<p>Having so long tried in vain the various measures
prescribed by the best medical advice, both at home, and
in different places he visited, Mr. Roby turned as a last
resource to the Water Cure. He went to Malvern in
the spring of 1847; looking up, as he afterwards said,
to those beautiful hills, as he approached them, with the
thought "I shall never walk there&mdash;I am only coming
to die." Encouragement being given him, to expect
ultimate recovery, and finding the process of cure would
be very slow, he at once broke up his establishment at
Rochdale, and fixed his residence for the time at Malvern.
His own medical attendant considered him past hope
when he left the north; nor was it in the power of
medicine to effect a cure. When he commenced the
trial of Hydropathy, Dr. Gully pronounced the sheath
of every nerve to be in a state of active inflammation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Almost every aliment he took increased the irritation;
medicine only added fuel to the flame. He pursued
the water treatment vigorously for some months, before
he perceived any benefit, and to his own indomitable
perseverance in following the prescribed directions he
owed, under the blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span>, his surprising restoration.
A remarkably good constitution, unimpaired by
excesses of any kind, gave every advantage to remedial
measures in combating disease, and in the end his case
proved an instance of the perfect success of those
measures.</p>

<p>Distinct as was his mental suffering in its true cause
from the physical malady, they aggravated each other,
and in recovery their mutual action was observable.
Faith and Hope by slow degrees gained strength; the
spirit insensibly grew calmer, the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> was seen
walking on the waves, and the tempest was hushed.
The burning anxiety within now quenched in the sense
of reconciliation with <span class="smcap">God</span>, "My Father" being at last
the delighted cry of the spirit; there was no longer a
latent impediment to the complete restoration of health.</p>

<p>The first palpable symptom of general improvement,
was the gradual return of his love for botany, and
pleasure in the pursuit. This was nurtured by his
excellent wife, who, with a delight which can only be
imagined by those who have watched the returning
health of some beloved one, induced him to make a
botanical object for their daily drives. The Flora of the
neighbourhood contained many rare plants only known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to him, through Sowerby's figures or dried specimens.
By degrees, amendment became more decidedly marked,
his native flow of spirits began to return, though at
first feebly: and she who through those years of
suffering&mdash;a period almost as painful to the patient's
friends as to himself&mdash;had nursed him with the tenderest
care, and unwearied affection, now realized the
sentiment of the poet,</p>

<p>She had her reward&mdash;she lived long enough to see
the object of her affectionate solicitude restored to
health, the powers of mind and body returning in full
force, and was then herself prostrated by an illness before
which her constitution gave way. She died peacefully
and happily, in the faith and hope of the Gospel, just as
a new year was opening with all its promise on others.
A blow so sudden and unexpected, was bewildering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the companion of years was gone, the bereaved one was
alone, and in new scenes. His efforts at cheerfulness in
the society of casual acquaintance, compared with the
mastery feeling would gain over him, when he entered
into the home society of nearer friends, attested the
severity of this new trial. But happily for the mourner,
he could recur to the calm and peace of those last
moments, they seemed to be to him, the most precious
of earthly recollections.</p>

<p>He once more turned to his pen, and sought a
healthy solace for his lonely hours in mental occupation,
first obtaining leave of his physician, who assured him
that the wish to write, intimated he might do so with
safety. During the ensuing summer and autumn he
gave what leisure the imperative claims of "the cure,"
permitted, to literary occupation of various kinds. But
still <i>home</i> was not the same, there was a kind of
dislocation in the social life (if the expression may be
allowed) he could not write as he was wont to do. He
persevered, and as months rolled on regained his usual
facility of composition. A tale of considerable length,
founded on the characteristics of modern life, occupied
him during the winter. Though lacking the romance of
the olden time, it was not deficient in stirring incident
and spirited dialogue. It appeared in "Hogg's Weekly
Instructor," from May to August 1850.</p>

writing, are among the few which, bearing
a date, allow of insertion in the right place. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>

<p>In the summer of 1849, Mr. Roby again married.
The loved, and almost idolized head of a happy home,
he appeared, as he had never before to those who only
knew him in his bereaved life, breathing an atmosphere
of happiness, and diffusing it around him, till even the
sorrowful grew bright with smiles, and</p>

<p>were lifted up again into the untroubled joy of childhood.
It was impossible the traveller should retain his
mantle of grief with such fervid sunshine around him.
The enthusiasm of his nature gathered new force from
the buoyancy of recovered health, and found its own
element in the exquisite woodland scenery lying among
the recesses of the Cotswold hills. To those who know
these woods, or have once seen them in the tender
luxuriance of very early summer, this term is not too
strong. The rich botanical treasures they presented,
were many of them new to him. The writer cannot
forget the intense pleasure with which he discovered
among the last year's beech leaves, and held up to view,
the beautiful <i>Epipactis grandiflora</i> (white helleborine),
which he had only once before seen, his companion,
never. Nor the delight with which on another occasion
he hailed the long-sought <i>Listera nidus avis</i> (birds-nest
ophrys), now found for the first time in its native
habitat. Nor did he lose the general impression of
nature in scientific details. The beautiful effects of
light and shadow, the peculiar blue air tint of the
beech woods, every thing that went to form the perfect
whole, seemed individually to fill his spirit with exquisite
pleasure. And as, in that evening's wandering
through the Cranham woods, with friends whose spirits
were kindred&mdash;looking down the hanging wood,
through a lengthening vista, the evening mist was seen
creeping on, its hues changing gradually from soft rose-colour
to deep purple, the novel and almost unearthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
beauty of the scene was such, that all caught his
rapture, and felt that never before had any thing so
vividly imaged the paradise of the spirit-world. It
might have been the painter's conception of Bunyan's
land of Beulah.</p>

<p>The early autumn of the year was spent among the
Cumberland mountains. Furnished with a botanical
tin, pressing-book, and sketch-book&mdash;the provision for
the day slung at the saddle-bow, some delightful
excursions of about five-and-twenty miles a day were
made. Nothing could be more congenial with his
buoyant, independent spirit, than the freedom of these
mountain rambles&mdash;professional guides dispensed with,
he always squire of dames, and horses too. Starting
early in the morning, dining one day on the mountain's
brow, the next in the recesses of Borrowdale, amid the
haunts of the rarer ferns, or under the shadow of
Honister Crag, in the silence of the mountain solitudes;
and then with the declining sun, treasure-laden, wending
our homeward way as the evening shadows crept on,
until,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>and the road lengthened itself out as if interminably,
till at last the lights twinkled cheeringly as Keswick
came in sight.</p>

<p>While thus with youth renewed&mdash;for certainly
Hydropathy in Mr. Roby's case seemed to effect more
than the mere removal of disease&mdash;life became one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
long holiday of enjoyment, it was also a period of
earnest work.</p>

<p>With no claims of a secular profession upon him, and
with a spirit chastened and hallowed by suffering, he
devoted his energies to literature principally, but at the
same time he was prompt to use his powers in any way
for the good of his fellow-men. Impressed more deeply
than ever with the conviction that in the faith, and
practice of Christianity alone, lie the true happiness and
virtue of our race; and that in the exercise of his
talents, man's only adequate aim is to be found in the
service of <span class="smcap">God</span>, he sought by a more constant infusion
of Christian principles, in the productions of his pen,
to give a corresponding tone to the minds of his
readers; thus working</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As ever in his great Task-master's eye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bearing in mind a truth burnt in by affliction, how
entirely he owed life and immortality to a Saviour's
love, he "loved much" in return, and found in that
love, a motive for unsparing labour. During his stay
at Keswick, he was placed in circumstances which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
called upon him to conduct the worship of a few poor
people from Sabbath to Sabbath. That self-distrust
which so eminently characterised him before <span class="smcap">God</span>, was
immediately roused. The pleasure he had known in
swaying large audiences, in striking out from listening
countenances the sympathetic flash, recurred to his mind,
and he feared, lest in holy things self-seeking should
intrude; "I am so afraid of running before I am sent,"
was the remark made in confidence, where each feeling
of the soul was uttered as it rose. But the call was
clear and distinct, the voice of "the Master" was heard
and obeyed. Sad and strange would it have been if the
tongue so eloquent for the gratification of his fellow-men,
had been silent when their highest welfare was to
be promoted&mdash;if that voice raised at man's request for
his passing pleasure, had been dumb for God. And
doubtless the light of the spirit-world, which even when
we only catch it dimly reflected from the mantles of the
ascending ones, resolves into</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The baseless fabric of a vision,"<br /></span>

<p>the objects of earthly ambition, has now confirmed the

while here, was to "<i>do the will</i>" of his Father in
heaven.</p>

when it is borne in mind, how intensely the writer of
the Tract had suffered, and how deep in consequence
was his sympathy with all mental distress. A poor
woman in the south of England was so weighed down
with family troubles, that she came one day to the
resolution of ending them that night, by throwing
herself into a river which ran hard by her dwelling.
Before evening, a gentleman who was not aware of the
state of her affairs, put into her hands a copy of the
tract referred to. The inquiry with which it was
headed, "Are you fit to die?" arrested her attention.
She felt she was not fit to die, and her resolution was
shaken&mdash;she deferred, at least for that night, fulfilling
her intention. The conviction of her unfitness for
another world deepened; she was led to seek forgiveness
and renewal of spirit&mdash;she found the way
of peace, and the last thing heard of her, was that her
worldly circumstances also were prospering. It may be
worth observing, that probably the tract had the more
point, entered more into the heart of the reader, from
the fact of its having been written with an individual
strongly before the author's mind. A young woman,
whose life was rapidly going in confirmed consumption,
while she was utterly unaware of her danger, had
excited his deepest interest. Merry, buoyant, well disposed
towards every one and every thing, except the
subject of religion; her dislike or fixed aversion to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
went beyond all bounds. The tract was written, but
before it was published he had lost all traces of her.</p>

<p>Most conspicuous during this journey was his untiring
industry combined with the variety of his pursuits,
no one of which seemed to interfere with another.
The industrious botanist, and equally industrious
artist, yet found leisure for careful reading, and the
use of the pen. Every moment had its occupation; the
rainy days were devoted to literary work or the finishing
of sketches, broken by a quiet game of chess. While
at Bowness Mr. Roby enjoyed one high gratification, a
few details of which, though given in a private letter,
may be inserted without apology, as the subject is of
general interest.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 8em;">"Saturday, Sept. 30th.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have seen Wordsworth to-day. As we accompanied
friends of my husband's (the Rev. J. H. and Mrs. Addison,
of Birthwaite Abbey) who happened to owe Mr. and Mrs.
Wordsworth a morning visit, we did not feel intruders. As
usual the day was brilliant, we had a delightful row up the
lake, the trees on the islands had the rich scarlet and russet
tints of autumn, while those on the shore still retained their
soft green, making the edges of the lake perfectly verdant.
A flight of snow that fell yesterday covered the tops of the
mountains which came out in the full sunshine, pure white
against the brightest of blue skies. Past the lake, we rowed
up the Rotha as far as it is practicable, and there leaving
the boats,&mdash;cloaks as well&mdash;moored to the margin of the
stream, we took a beautiful path, through private grounds,
on the left of the river, passing Fox How, from whence I
bring you an ivy relic, to Rydal Mount. <i>Mr.</i> Wordsworth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
(as of course he is here,) was just sitting down to dinner; he
came out and begged us to stay in the drawing-room, or in
the grounds if we preferred it, till dinner was over. We
chose to stroll about, which gave time for a sketch. After
a short time, Mr. Wordsworth came and took us into the
drawing-room to see Mrs. W. He was not so tall as I
had expected, probably the effect of years; his voice somewhat
indistinct, gave indications of old age, not so his ideas
or expressions. The lower part of his face is deeply furrowed;
but when sitting with his back to the light, animated
in conversation, every thing is lost in its glowing expression,
except his noble expanse of forehead. He chatted away on
literary matters with my husband, evidently with hearty
pleasure. They talked of a distinguished living writer; of
his style, Mr. Wordsworth remarked, that every sentence
seemed finished by itself, which was never the case with our
best writers&mdash;that reviewing had an injurious effect on the
style of a literary man, the reviewer has ever to be saying
something that will tell, every sentence must be striking.</p>

<p>"Allusion was made to a new neighbour; Wordsworth
observed that she was clever, but apt to be imposed on; he
confessed that on the whole, he was sorry she had come
there, on account of her habit of not going to a place of
worship: the example might do no harm in London, Manchester,
and those large places, where people did not know
their next-door neighbour, but here it was different, and no
good she could do would be equal to the harm of her
example; 'but,' he added, 'I like her benevolence, and forgive
many things for that.' One other remark he made must
not be forgotten; speaking of a writer whom he considered
not a safe guide on account of his prejudices, he said, 'He is
so prejudiced he does not know when he lies.'</p>

<p>"Altogether the visit was one of high delight. There was
so much more enthusiasm about him, than from the philosophic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
cast of his poems I had expected. The genial glow of his
manner, the warmth of his shake of hands at parting, and
especially the quick pleasure with which he turned round to
his wife whenever she made a remark, and the affectionate
tone in which, when he did not catch it, he would inquire,
'What did you say, Mary'? quite won my heart. He impressed
us, too, as a Christian living in obedience to, and
communion with Heaven. His personal character seemed to
come out with a completeness one would hardly have believed
possible in our interview. I shall understand and love
all he has written, the better for this visit."</p></div>

<p>Returning homewards, Mr. Roby made several visits
among his family and friends. Little was it thought
when one gratification and another were deferred
owing to the lateness of the season till the <i>next</i> visit,
that this was the <i>last</i>. The cordiality and pleasure
with which he was welcomed, left a delightful recollection
of Lancashire and Yorkshire hospitality. The
country had not yet lost all its beauty, the rich
Autumn tints of October were still lingering on the
Bolton Woods: the Wharfe gave forth his peculiar
music as he rushed along his rocky bed in the open
meadow, or dashed madly over the fearful Strid, till
even those accustomed to gaze drew back from the
fascination. One day was devoted to York, the metropolis
of his native North. His familiarity with the
remains of antiquity so pre-eminently abounding in
that city, and his enthusiasm equal to his knowledge,
rendered him one of the best of Ciceroni. Ever vivid
will be the impressions of that day; the grandeur of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the Minster, as the South Front, with its beautiful
marygold window comes suddenly into view at the
end of the old narrow street; the solemnity which
seemed to pervade the very atmosphere within; the
seven sisters memorialized in those unique chaste
lights which bear their name&mdash;and never was the light
of Heaven intercepted by aught so soft, so subdued, so
meet for a Temple of the Most High, with no distraction
from higher thought in its beauty&mdash;and the incomparable
west windows, where the tracery is so light,
and the colouring so gorgeous, that it seems as if the
stone work were melting into gems. And how was all
that glory heightened as it was reflected back from his
spirit, the true home of the beauty which the material
can only symbolize.</p>

<p>The Red Tower, the scene of one of his published
tales; the site of the Roman Pr&aelig;torium, the scene of
another; the unrivalled Museum gardens, with their
Roman and Gothic remains, the Multangular Tower
and St. Mary's Abbey, the city walls, &amp;c., &amp;c., all
that could be seen in one day, by the help of good
walking, and unflagging spirits, contributed to our
enjoyment. What could not be brought in, was left
for future years, so fondly reckoned on, when a stay of
weeks or months in the city was to allow all its
recesses to be explored, and the spirit of the place to
be thoroughly imbibed. Yet beyond all comparison
with the other pleasures of the day, great as they were,
was the enjoyment in a manner created by his intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
delight in the present, and in the plans for the future;&mdash;yet
of that future "if the Master will," was ever on
his lips. The hour that came "as a thief in the night,"
found him watching.</p>

<p>By Christmas, Mr. Roby had settled down at Malvern,
and commenced his winter's work. His habit was to
devote the first hour or half hour after breakfast, to
religious reading, selecting such works as bore on
personal or devotional, rather than on theoretic or
polemical subjects. Among the last he read, were some
new favorites:&mdash;Hodge's "Way of Life," and his "Commentary
on the Epistle to the Romans;" Alleine's
"Heaven Opened," and Sheppard's "Devotional
Thoughts." "Milner's Sermons," which had long held
the highest place in his estimation, were frequently in
hand. The rest of the forenoon was given to literary occupation,
as were the evenings when not spent in society.
The only interruption to this quiet course of life, was
the delivery of his Lectures on Botany; (which had been
given two months previously at Northampton,) before
the Worcestershire Natural History Society, in January,
1850. This would scarcely be worthy of mention,
were it not for a circumstance which arose out of the
engagement. While arranging the diagrams preparatory
to the delivery of the last lecture, Mr. Roby
incautiously stepped too near the back of the platform,
which was protected only by a curtain, his left foot
slipped, and the right leg was bent back from the
knee on which the whole weight of the body was consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
thrown. He had, however, the self-command
to go through the lecture without in the least betraying
what he suffered, except by the lameness involuntarily
shown when he had occasion to move in order to
point out the different illustrations; but the agony he
endured was intense, and he reached home sick and
faint from its long continuance. His power of bearing
pain often excited surprise and admiration in those who
witnessed it, so complete in his case was the "power
of the soul over the body." It was mental, not bodily,
anguish that he dreaded. Mr. Roby never quite recovered
from the effects of this accident, though, contrary
to the expectation of those who were acquainted with
the extent of the injury, by the time he left Malvern in
June, they were not perceptible in his walk. The
muscles, however, had not fully regained their play,
the act of kneeling was difficult and painful; mounting
gaps and fences in his botanical rambles still more so;
he was ever fearful of a stray stone, feeling that a
trifle might occasion a fall: and this, it is apprehended,
must have increased his peril on the awful morning of
the 18th of June.</p>

<p>In spite of pain, he worked hard during the winter
and spring. He finished a series of papers, containing a
popular introduction to Botany; wrote two reviews, one
for the Literary Gazette on Dr. Addison's recent work
on Consumption; the other, for Hogg's Weekly Instructor,
on a work which had just appeared by the
author of "Dr. Hookwell," entitled "Dr. Johnson, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Religious Life and Death." But his principal occupation
was the composition of a series of tales, intended to
illustrate the influence of Christianity in successive
periods. At this he laboured incessantly. The consecration
of his talents in any way their nature admitted
to the service of <span class="smcap">Him</span> whom with George Herbert he
delighted to call "My Master," was the mainspring of
his untiring energy. And when only once the voice of
affection suggested that he was working too hard, he
replied, as though with a presentiment of the sudden
coming on of night to him, to the effect that he had
not long to work, adding, "I must not sit still and see
the stream run by." He prepared six of the tales (deferring
one for the fourth century till he had received
a copy of a work which a friend had promised on
the Druidical Worship), thus bringing the series down
to the close of the seventh century, when superstitious
rites and observances began to overspread Christendom.
At the end of the closing tale he glances at the gathering
darkness, and thus concludes with the last words he
ever wrote for the press:&mdash;"In our next we shall trace
some of those mysterious dispensations,&mdash;inscrutable to
us, but doubtless among the 'all things' which work
together for good, and 'for the furtherance of his
gospel.'" It is not surprising that these words, little
noticed when first listened to, on the completion of
the story, should, when seen again a few weeks after
the sad catastrophe, seem like words of comfort which
affection had unconsciously traced against the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
need. Little more was accomplished besides sketching
out future occupation for the pen in old and new directions.
An instance of the latter now vividly recurs
to mind: seeing Tieck's Phantasien one morning on a
friend's table, he borrowed it, to ascertain if a translation
of the tales would suit a purpose he had in view,
and to try how two minds could work together.
The experiment was perfectly successful. Very slightly
acquainted with the language himself, the tale was
read off to him in what English, or sometimes half
Germanized English, was at command: the rough-hewn
thought was instantly apprehended in all its beauty and
meaning by the listener, and given back, in his own
polished style, rather "a transfusion than translation."
The pleasure was unexpectedly cut short in the midst
of a tale, after the second or third evening, and it was
with a feeling, even then recognised as akin to foreboding,
that the unfinished volume was returned to the
friend whose sudden departure from Malvern thus put
an end to the delightful occupation.</p>

<p>As the spring advanced, and the effects of the accident
were so much diminished as to allow of the free exercise
of walking, Mr. Roby renewed his botanical rambles,
generally in the society of friends; and very pleasant
were these little parties that wound over the hill-top or
through the woody lanes and green meadows of Herefordshire,
in search of plants to supply his own and his
friends' desiderata, or those of the London Botanical
Society, of which he was a member. And, quick as was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
his eye for rare plants, it caught even more quickly
those beautiful effects on the landscape which the
changeful skies of spring so often produce, making a
perfect picture of an old farm-stead a broken foreground,
contrasting with the soft retiring distance or
the gently swelling slopes, where beneath the trees
scarcely yet in leaf the wind flowers bowed as the breeze
passed over them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the crowning botanical pleasure of the
season was his lighting upon the beautiful <i>Pinguicula
vulgaris</i> (common Butterwort) in a spongy place on the
hill. He seemed the very personification of happiness,
as he hastened home, with buoyant step and sparkling
eye, to one whose desire to see, equalled his own to
show, this pride of our bogs. Often in the preceding
autumn at the Lakes had the pale green star-like tuft of
leaves called forth eloquent praises of its beauty, and
corresponding regrets that the time of its flowering was
over for the season. The Lancashire Asphodel was the
one other flower which he most regretted not being able
to show, as its withered spikes indicated again and again
where it had bloomed.</p>

<p>Spring was deepening into summer, when Mr. Roby
made arrangements for a journey into Scotland. Furnished,
through the kindness of a friend, with introductions
to the best society in the neighbourhood of
Edinburgh, with the prospect of the meeting of the
British Association, and the anticipation of renewing
mountain rambles, he looked forward to the summer
with raised expectations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>In approaching the last few hours the writer feels the
alternative lies between making the slightest possible
reference to them, or casting herself on the reader's
sympathy and indulgence, and using details which were
written three years since, with near friends, rather than
the public, before her mind. Thrown suddenly into
circumstances where the sway of grief was broken by
constantly recurring necessity for thought and action,
the mind was excited and over-strained to incessant exertion
rather than stunned, and under the prolonged
excitement, it could go again over scenes which it is
now too much a coward to encounter. She, therefore,
hopes there is no error in adopting the course now pursued,
and embodying the private MS. in the general
narrative.</p>

<p>We left Malvern for Egremont June 7th. The ten
days passed there were occupied with the interests of
the two boys whom their father was anxious to see set
out in life. When he came in tired with a long morning
spent in Liverpool, after a few moments' rest, he
would turn to a sketch that had been in progress during
his absence, and, fatigue all vanishing, would call for
pencil and colours, take his seat at the window, and
go on with the drawing. It was a great favourite of
his. Of all the pleasures with which life was replete,
none delighted him more than this, both working on
the same picture, without betraying by any want
of unity in the design or harmony in the colouring,
that two minds had been engaged. <i>That drawing</i> alas!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which he fondly called "the best yet," lies in the ill-fated
wreck.</p>

<p>Pleasant, and yet painful, are the memoirs of evening
rambles along the beach watching the vessels as they
came and went. One elegant yacht, which his artist
eye detected among the numerous craft, is well remembered:
he fixed her form in his mind, and destined her for
"the drawing"&mdash;one of the many unfulfilled purposes.</p>

<p>The last sabbath came, and it was a day of peace. We
worshipped <span class="smcap">God</span> together; that hymn of Dr. Watts', so
great a favourite of his from its touching contrasts,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Give me the wings of Faith to rise," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>opened the last service. As we walked home in the
evening we felt mentally invigorated: he seemed more
than ever penetrated with a sense of consecration to the
service of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and we communed of how, in our coming
sojourn amid new scenes, He might best be served.
"He will make it plain, He will point out our work for
us," was my beloved husband's closing remark.</p>

<p>At three o'clock p.m. on Monday 17th June we
embarked on board the steamer Orion for Scotland,
hoping to reach Glasgow by ten, and Edinburgh by one
o'clock the next day. Nothing could be calmer than
the sea, and we walked for hours on the deck, watching
any vessel that came in sight, and catching at intervals
distant glimpses of the coast. Our favourite spot was
a narrow ledge at the stern immediately behind the
wheel. It just gave us footing, and enabled us to look
over and watch the track left by the vessel as she cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
rapidly through the waves. The white foam, the
various shades of pale green, darkening as we seemed to
look down into the depths of the ocean, recalled descriptions
of the glaciers, and the correctness of the
supposed resemblance my husband confirmed from his
own recollections.</p>

<p>Evening wore on&mdash;we took our last meal together on
deck. The Isle of Man came in sight; a sketch was
taken for his approbation; and the bright smile that
rewarded it is sunshine even now. All recollections of
him are happy: the animation and hope with which he
repeatedly expressed his belief that his daughter's health,
which was not firm, would be completely established by
the voyage; the quiet satisfaction of his manner as we
sat enjoying the present, sometimes glancing forward to
the morrow, all bespoke happiness. Indeed, all the
characteristics of a happy life seemed to meet in those
few hours. There was the earnestness and the tenderness
of affection: there was, too, its playfulness. There
was the thought of still holier things: strong was the
wish he expressed that we could have been at the lowly
meeting for prayer, which was announced the night
before for that evening. There was the love and admiration
of nature, as the glories of sunset deepened behind
the Manx mountains, and from his post of observation
he again and again, in his own earnest and animated
manner, called me to his side.</p>

<p>Chess&mdash;that recreation which seemed ever to have the
effect on his mind which exercise out of doors has on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
jaded frame&mdash;was then resorted to; and having found an
antagonist, he went down into the saloon for a game.
As we were passing the light-house at the northern extremity
of the Isle of Man, which he had expressed a
great wish to see, I called him up. After watching it
for a minute he went down again, remarking the game
would soon be finished.</p>

<p>In order that neither lady should be left alone, particularly
as one was in delicate health, it was arranged
that he should take a berth in the gentlemen's cabin,
and his daughter and I have a small cabin to ourselves,
our cabin and his being as near as possible.</p>

<p>The last lady who remained above besides myself
was the niece of Dr. Burns. We had very agreeable
conversation. She had taken the trip many times, and
I anticipated the pleasure my husband would have,
when we met at the breakfast-table in the morning, in
making so pleasant and intelligent an acquaintance.</p>

<p>When we parted for the night, between eleven and
twelve o'clock, I went down into the saloon to make a
few arrangements for the morning, and, half afraid lest
a sudden diversion of his ideas should lose my husband
the honour of victory, was just beginning some little
apology for the interruption, when he looked up with a
smile, that said, "you are no interruption," and replied
"I am coming directly." I returned on deck only for
a short time, when, thinking it better to retire, and
finding beds were making up in the saloon for the night,
I called the steward and committed his dressing case to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
his keeping. Oh, that I had waited! but had I, I should
have lost that blessed promise of speedy re-union as the
last words I ever heard from him.</p>

<p>My husband had more than once said to me, "Do not
undress," and to that, under the providence of God, I
believe Lilla and I owed our safety. I fell asleep about
twelve o'clock. When the shock came, and the working
of the engines, which even in one's sleep was heard,
suddenly ceased, we were instantly aroused; and, looking
at my watch to see the hour, in order to have some
known fact by which to collect oneself, I found it was
a quarter past one a.m. I jumped down from the
berth, and, after hastily swallowing a little brandy and
water that happened to be in the cabin, to check the
sudden sick feeling of fright, put on bonnet and cloak,
and went on deck to learn what was the matter, first
calling at my husband's cabin door to see if he were
there. The gentlemen assured me he was up and gone,
and knowing, as I did, his intention of not undressing,
and his quick habit of movement, I was satisfied that I
should find him on deck. He was not there, at least
not on the after-deck, where we had been together.
All hands had evidently rushed to the fore-part of the
vessel, whence the alarm came, and doubtless he had
gone there at once, to ascertain what was the matter
before he alarmed us. Persons on deck said we were
too near land, had run a-ground, but should be off
presently. The light at the harbour was distinctly seen
rather behind us, to our right; as was the high ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
above Port Patrick, apparently a very little distance off;
while the fog concealed the promontory right a-head of
us, against which we must have dashed in a few moments,
had we not struck at the time we did. I went down
again to tell Lilla that they said there was no danger,
but at the same time assisted her to throw a few things
hastily on, and then went on deck. In the meantime
my husband had not come to us. I went to his cabin
door again, to ask if he were there; but the inmates
were in such confusion they could give me no answer.
Returning up the gang-way again, I met the steward,
and stood some minutes under the lamp, while he looked
down his way-bill, to ascertain that I was right in my
husband's number. He assured me that we should get
off. On deck once again, I perceived that the vessel
inclined much more, that the fore-part had sunk considerably:
the noise and confusion were all there. The
after-deck was comparatively free from persons; a few,
indeed, were trying to lower one of the boats. We
walked about, looking for my husband, who was, I
have now no doubt, entangled among the crowd of
persons in the fore-part, where most of the two hundred
on board had run. He must have been almost the first
on deck; others rushed after him in that direction: a
rope&mdash;the slightest thing catching the weak leg&mdash;would
throw him down, and, with the noise and confusion,
which at any time would have been bewildering, it must
have been impossible for him to disentangle himself.
What hindered me from running down into the crowd to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
look for him, I know not, unless it were the persuasion
that he would instinctively come to the spot where we
had been together, as I had done; the expectation each
moment that he would come seemed to fill my mind: it
never once occurred to me that he might be in greater
danger than ourselves. Only the conviction that the
will of God was done can prevent the mind from
agonizing longings for that night to come over again,
were it a thousand times, for the merest chance of trying
to save him.</p>

<p>The vessel was perceptibly going down in the fore-part,
when the captain jumped on the skylight, and
assured the passengers that if they could remain in the
vessel they would be saved. This seemed probable, as
the shore boats were seen in the twilight putting towards
us; but, alas! we were now too rapidly sinking
to allow of their near approach. The vessel lurched
gradually towards the shore. We had placed ourselves
on the part which, from the position of the ship, would
be longest above water, with the foot resting on the
ledge, where we had so happily stood in the afternoon.
It enabled us to grasp a rope which came down from
the mizen-mast to the edge of the vessel, and there
awaited her going down, which I now saw was inevitable.
We felt the power of God could save us, if such
were His will, or His mercy receive us to Himself: it
was not a new thing to approach Him, or to resign
ourselves into His hands; it was no strange God, but
our long-loved Father in Heaven, before whom we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
were about to appear. So we rested with calm confidence
on that most blessed assurance, "Him that
cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out," and committed
ourselves to our Saviour's hands.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, a sudden hissing excited fears of
an explosion, and we sank immediately, the hot water
rushing up to us as we went down. Rising again, before
my head was above water, I felt something at the
back of my hand: I instinctively grasped it&mdash;it was a
rope. A moment after I was on the surface. I exchanged
the rope for a spar, and turning round my head
to ask for Lilla, found, to my inexpressible joy, she
was close behind me, just as we had sunk. This cheered
us both with hope of eventual safety. But where was
one far dearer? I grasped with my left hand one of
those fenders made of netted cords, which are used to
prevent ships coming into too close contact with each
other, or with the harbour; but it was hard work to
keep up. We encouraged each other, and, recollecting
that the human body is lighter than the same bulk of
water, we tried to float; but this was no easy matter.
The number of persons struggling in the water agitated
it, and in the endeavour to keep it out of the ears by
raising the head, the equilibrium was disturbed, and the
feet sank, and with that the dread of going down again
came. By the stopping of my watch at half-past one,
it afterwards appeared that a quarter of an hour elapsed
between the striking of the vessel and her going down,
and probably nearly as long passed between our rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and our being picked up by the shore boats. It was a
work of some difficulty and time, when they came up,
to extricate us from the ropes: our benumbed limbs and
weakened frames rendered us incapable of making any
effort ourselves. "Never mind, you are come among
Christian people," was the boatman's exclamation, when
he had taken me into the boat, and never was truer
word spoken. The heart-felt sympathy and substantial
kindness we received from all classes could not have
been exceeded, and can hardly be imagined. It is
impossible to speak too strongly of the goodness and
care of kind Mrs. Hannay, who first received us, and
whose husband formed and superintended the admirable
arrangements by which so many were saved. Placed
in bed, and hot cordials being administered, the warmth
gradually returned to our benumbed limbs, and we felt
<i>we</i> were restored to life. Dear Lilla began to indulge
hope that her papa was saved too; but I felt he was
with <span class="smcap">God</span>, he was so spiritually near; and when the
ring he usually wore was brought me, the agony of that
moment only confirmed what I knew too well before.
Even the catastrophe, fearful as it was, could scarcely
be called unexpected; I felt that what I had been
looking for had come, for we had both felt we were too
happy for this world. He had himself often exclaimed
"how will all this end? it cannot last." It was a
mournful but a blessed thing to gaze again on that
beloved face, with all the glow of health upon it, and
more than a placid, a bright smile&mdash;but to part from it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
thus! Even yet I cannot associate death in the ordinary
sense with it.</p>

<p>The first words of comfort, when we knew the extent
of our loss, were from the Rev. A. Urquhart and his
sister; and precious were their sympathy and manifold
kindness. The most deeply grateful feelings will ever
be associated with the thought of the Rev. S. Balmer,
in whose hospitable manse we remained for many days,
while Mrs. Balmer nursed us as a sister. There was
another bond between us, besides that of our common
humanity,&mdash;that of Christianity. We felt that we were
not with strangers, but with friends who shared every
feeling, that we were all looking from the same point of
view, and recognising the same hand. There were personal
links too&mdash;fellow-sufferers came in to whom my
beloved husband's works were known. On the shelves
of the manse library were those of my own venerable
relative, the late Dr. Ryland, of Bristol; and Lilla
found that her mamma's brother-in-law, the late Rev.
J. Ely, of Leeds, had been known to our host. Trifling
as such things were, they brought a feeling akin to
comfort. There is a gratification in mentioning the
names of friends to whom so much is owing, and it
would be ungrateful not to add that of Mr. and Mrs.
Hunter Blair of Dunskaie, whose proffered kindnesses
were more than the desirableness of remaining near the
shore would allow us to accept.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> Truly were we "<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><i>an
hungered, and ye gave us meat</i>; we were <i>thirsty, and ye
gave us drink</i>, we were <i>strangers, and ye took us in;
naked, and ye clothed us</i>; we were <i>sick, and ye visited
us</i>." Be the blessing of "those that were ready to
perish" upon them.</p>

<p>For no kindness is gratitude so deeply felt as for that
which aided the heart's cherished wish to have those
remains, so loved and so precious, removed from beside
that ever moaning sea, where they could never have
been thought of, without all the horrors of that scene
recurring too. To his own family grave, in the burial-ground
of the Independent Chapel, Rochdale, they were
borne on Saturday the 22d; followed by members of
his family, and about forty gentlemen of the town and
neighbourhood, who thus spontaneously expressed their
sense of his loss. <i>There</i> now rests "all that could die"
of the man of high intellect, of the loved and honoured,
the loving and confiding husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Farewell! a brief farewell! nay, no farewell to <i>thee</i>&mdash;<i>thou</i>
art not severed from us. Spirit as thou art, thou
still comest to live and blend with ours in the dim
twilight, and when the hum of the world is busy around
us. And when we bow in prayer to the Father of
Spirits, we feel that we are come not only to "Jesus
the Mediator," but to "the spirits of just men made
perfect," and we worship together in company. Farewell,
then, only thou beloved form, whose radiant smile
seemed to tell there had been no gathering of the darkness
of death, only a stepping from mortal into immortal
<span class="smcap">life</span>; and farewell, even to thee, only for a
season, for we know that "them that sleep in Jesus
will God bring with him." We shall yet see thee
again, and dwell with thee in eternal re-union, in a
world where the very memory of thy loss shall have
vanished, for "there shall be no more sea."</p>

<p>The foregoing brief sketch, little more than the
enumeration of ordinary events and literary pursuits,
would alone convey a very inadequate idea of one
whose character was peculiarly his own. One of the
many definitions by which it has been attempted to
analyse the subtle nature of genius is "the power of
interpreting nature." In the case of Mr. Roby, it took
the form of art, and he laboured in her train, whether
with pen or pencil, rather than in the service of science.
Looking over the face of nature, he would catch her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
slightest hints, and transfer to his paper&mdash;not just what
met the ordinary gaze, but&mdash;a picture. As if nature
by her scattered rocks and wandering clouds, gave him
in rude symbolic language, her thought of beauty, and
as he with initiated eye, read the meaning, there
presently grew under his pencil the full interpretation,
a silent poem, which every passer by might more or less
comprehend, and enjoy.</p>

<p>And were it the <i>voice</i> of nature that met his ear,
that voice whose floating music so few perceive, it had
as ready an interpreter. When in the social circle, or
in the busy street, the inner sense caught the inarticulate
sounds, he would note them down, and present
to others the melody which had charmed himself.</p>

<p>And eloquently would nature speak to him of truths
pertaining to humanity; felicitously were they apprehended
and expressed, he lingering meanwhile till she
had taught all her meaning.</p>

<p>Our great Maker gives to some men general excellence
of parts, so as to secure success in whatever
pursuit they follow; others are more exquisitely
moulded, and receive from His hand that peculiar and
indestructible form of genius, which no external circumstances
can affect. It was that general superiority
of abilities, which would alone have secured Mr. Roby
eminence in any walk of life he had chosen; but the
mechanical routine of monetary transactions could
not prevent the artist's eye from guiding his pencil,
render the ear deaf to the latent melody, or hinder for a
moment the genius stamped as creative by its Maker
from peopling the old ruins of the Past with living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
forms of beauty or of terror. Education could no more
train mere excellence of parts to this, than any process
of progressive development raise the lower orders of
creation into the higher.</p>

<p>Combined with the poetic fancy was a character of
high moral tone, a disposition, generous, open-hearted,
and impetuous, sensitive, and confiding; irresistibly
drawn towards the supernatural, yet as prone to
humour. That fine purity of feeling which marked his
writings, was equally a personal quality. His sense of
honour was quick, as his standard was high. Naturally
he would have preferred death itself to the slightest
shade of dishonour on his name. Faithful to the command
implied in the inspired delineation of the upright
man, it might be taken for the description of his
own course,&mdash;"he that sweareth to his own hurt and
changeth not." Incapable himself of mean or sordid
action, he never anticipated it in others; unselfish to a
degree, he perhaps calculated too much on the same
generosity of feeling in the world. The editor of the
Gentleman's Magazine, in a notice, which appeared in
October 1850, alludes to "his well-known liberality to
literary men," a reference amply confirmed by other incidental
testimony; but though literary acquaintances
were often the topic of home conversation, he never
spoke of any kindness it had been in his power to show
them. It was the highest luxury he knew, thus to
mitigate the perplexities or wants of others, but it was
only by accident that his family would discover it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Even when he dropped money into a poor man's hand,
he would hurry away as if he had done something
wrong, and wanted to forget it.</p>

<p>Another phase of the same disposition, was the
generous pleasure with which he regarded the gifts or
acquirements of others. Most cordially did he recognise
talent of any kind, no matter in whom, or under what
form it appeared. He was as free from envious or
jealous feeling as from common selfishness. This arose
from a fine nature,&mdash;which embraced as kindred
spirits those from whom morbid self-love might have
shrunk as rivals&mdash;not from an overweening or even
just sense of his own superiority: in that he was
unusually deficient.</p>

<p>In truth his want of self-valuation, almost of appreciation
of his own powers, was very noticeable. He
would exercise his talents, as a bird does its power of
song, for very pleasure, but without any thought of
display. "I know," he would say, "that many others
cannot do the things I do, but I do not feel as if I had
done anything worth thinking of, it falls so far below
the point I wish to reach." His delight in giving
pleasure supplied this want of the Phrenologist's <i>Self-esteem</i>,
as regarded others, but to himself, the lack of it,
joined to his extremely sensitive disposition, was in fact
a destitution of defensive armour; hence it was in the
power of minds far inferior to his own to torture him.
A similar deficiency was the absence of that worldly
wisdom, which in combination with a fine and generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
disposition, is so valuable to its possessors. The deprivation
of it occasioned a transparent simplicity of
character, which again left him too often at the mercy
of coarse ungenerous natures.</p>

<p>That intense yearning for sympathy, which was
noticed as a characteristic of his childhood, followed him
through life, and seemed to increase with his years. His
many resources, though capable of yielding the purest
pleasure, could not fill the void. They concealed the
longing from observers, but left the heart often aching.
Frank and confiding himself, he looked for the same
frankness in others. The slightest reserve chilled and
wounded him, and threw him back on himself. "An
unkind word or look," he would frequently say, "nay a
chilling one, from those I respect and esteem, is misery
to me." His happiness was indeed a delicate thing, for
though the writer can say she never knew any one
made happy with so little effort&mdash;the very <i>wish</i> to
make him so, evinced, was enough&mdash;yet she often felt,
and trembled to feel, how intensely miserable it was in
the power of any one he loved, to make him.</p>

<p>His natural vivacity concealed another feature of his
character from the general eye, which was yet discernible
by those who studied him. "Spare me," said he one
day to a lady, half jocosely, "I am so shy." "You
shy!" she exclaimed, protesting against the possibility
of such a thing. He quietly acquiesced, and let it
pass. "You would not think that I was naturally shy,"
said he a few days after to a friend who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
present, with whom he was now engaged in a pleasant
little disquisition on psychology, and who, he afterwards
allowed, knew more of his real character from a
few months' acquaintance than any one had done before.
"Yes I should," was her unhesitating reply. "Why,
how should you think so!" he exclaimed in astonishment.
"Your attitudes and movements betray it. I
do not say as Robert Hall did of an acquaintance,
that you seem begging pardon of all men for being
in existence, but you do often seem begging pardon of
your company for being in their presence, when they
are only too happy to have your society. You would
creep into a nutshell, rather than be where you thought
you were not wanted."</p>

<p>Not an uncommon, but a pleasing trait, was that humanity
to the animal creation which marked him from
boyhood. Not only did he never "heedlessly" set "foot
upon a worm," but he would carefully remove it from
the path, lest some other foot should crush it. Cruelty
of any kind called forth his strongest reprehension.</p>

<p>One great charm of his character, was its perfect
retention of the freshness of youth. The most juvenile
in the company could not but feel that he was as young
in spirit as themselves. His regular and temperate
habits of life no doubt contributed to this, as did his
love of simple pleasures. He never sought the false
excitement of artificial stimulants. His own buoyancy
of spirits, and ever-varied pursuits, most of all perhaps
the exhilaration of botanical "field sports," were the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
stimulants which fed the flame of life, while they made
it burn more brightly. Even in those years when the
smile or quick repartee often only concealed, but could
not remove, the secret care or the unsatisfied craving
for some undefined blessing, that preyed within, the
change to a new pursuit, or a fresh path for thought
and energy, were the only means to which he had recourse
"to keep the mind from preying on itself."</p>

<p>To those who knew him best it is easy to trace much
of his personal character in his writings. His social
disposition, and particularly this freshness of spirit,
gave a tone to all he wrote. The high ideal of woman
maintained in the "Traditions," has been already noticed:
he was quick to perceive fragmentary indications of that
ideal, in real life. True to Haydon's motto which he so
often quoted, "Ex pede Hercules," one trait of disinterestedness,
of self-sacrifice, of intuitive perception of the
good, was sufficient, and his imagination therefrom
created,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A perfect woman, nobly plann'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A nice observer of the indications of character, he
detected, with a quickness approaching to intuition, those
little peculiarities of manner and expression which
intimate the disposition and habit of thought, and often
after a very brief acquaintance, he would by a few
touches draw a mental portrait to the life, yet without
the slightest approach to caricature, which he would have
abhorred as deformity. This habit of close observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and quick perception contributed to the variety and
individuality of his delineations. He was remarkably
susceptible of impressions, hence he was open to influences
which others escape. A very unpleasing expression
of countenance would act upon him so strongly, that he
would go far out of his way to avoid it. In a similar
manner, certain appearances of the clouds in an electrical
state of the atmosphere would from childhood impress
him painfully, even at times with a sentiment almost
akin to horror; and this in spite of a constitution, over
which the state of the weather ordinarily had no
power; the spirit seemed directly operated on through
the eye.</p>

<p>One of his strongest natural tendencies, which had
considerable influence in the creations of his fancy, was
a love of the supernatural. Nothing contented him till
he had traced it up to that subtle point where spiritual
relations begin. "Why should such a thing affect us
thus?" was the question which he delighted to ask
himself. To his mind, as indeed to all thoughtful ones,
the mysterious was the element into which all the phenomena
of life resolved themselves. And there he took
his stand, watching before the veil, if perchance some
hand from within would lift its folds. The mutual
relations of mind and matter, the secret sympathies of
spirit, and the extent of its independence of sense, were
chosen topics of thought. The enlarged views of these
subjects which modern science is opening before us, at
once indicating the direction of future inquiry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
retrospectively interpreting the wildest records of the
past, thus resolving romance into reality, had especial
charm for him. The reverse of credulous, he would
subject a fact to close investigation, before he gave it
credence, but at the same time a latent affinity with
the supernatural, if the expression be allowed, drew him
to it: hence astrology attracted him, but after close
study, he gave it up for various reasons, principally
that a kind of Christian instinct, which will often
advance when the understanding stops short, warned
him off, by a sentiment, of approaching forbidden
ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Roby was a striking instance of how far literary
pursuits may be followed without neglect of the duties
of life. "Literature to a man who must have a profession"
observes Sir Walter Scott, "should be the recreation
not the serious business of life." Mr. Roby's
success in his profession was such as to lead another
banker of eminence&mdash;not prejudiced by the tie of private
friendship&mdash;to term him the first accountant in Europe.
Bearing in mind the pursuits of him of whom the remark
was made, it proves that a successful career as an author,
is not incompatible with eminence in the ordinary business
of life. A strength of moral purpose, which would not
allow pleasant occupation to infringe on the prior
claims of duty, and which led him inflexibly to follow
the course he had laid down as right, gave force to a
character that else might have been deemed too brilliant
for every-day wear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>One remarkable endowment that must have contributed
to his success in his own walk in life, was a
power he possessed of determining the amount of any
sum of figures that might be laid before him. The
friend an extract from whose letter was given on p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>,
thus alludes to this faculty. "If a double column,
twenty figures in each row, or a cube of six, arranged
as below, were placed before him, he would tell the sum
as soon as his eye could read the figures.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 1<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp; 5 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 9<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp; 6 &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; 9<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp; 7 &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; 9 &nbsp; 2<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; 7 &nbsp; 8 &nbsp; 4<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp; 4 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 3<br /></span>
<span class="i0">--------------------<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He arrived at the result without going through the
ordinary process; he saw it at a glance. If, as was
rarely the case, owing to a passing fit of dulness, or a
momentary distraction of thought, he failed to see the
sum at once, he was rather slow than otherwise in
doing it by the ordinary mode. Mr. Roby himself told
me, that Bidder, perhaps the most wonderful calculator
this country ever produced, though his superior in some
points, could not approach him here."</p>

<p>Their respective powers must have been the result
of two different faculties. In "the calculating boy," it
was extraordinary rapidity of <i>calculation</i>. In Mr. Roby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
it was not calculation at all, but <i>combination</i>. He read
and combined the figures into a whole, as we should
read the word <span class="smcap">comparison</span>, for instance, without spelling
it; the power of the figures in the one case, being
equivalent to that of the letters in the other. Perhaps
the extraordinary strength and activity of his perceptive
faculties, combined with considerable talent for the
science of number, may account for it: the rapidity
of his perceptions was at all times marvellous. He had
not trained himself to this exercise, nor was it a faculty
at all improved by use. He found out accidentally one
day that he possessed it, and it never varied afterwards.
The writer is not aware that he practised to any extent
what is termed mental arithmetic. Yet some extraordinary
calculations he made with a pack of cards, by
a process carried on in his mind, which, if put on paper
would have covered many sheets, appears to have been
of that nature. In all such matters which depended on
numerical arrangement, he was quite <i>au fait</i>. On
one occasion he saw a lady perform a trick called Sir
Isaac Newton's. She declined showing how it was
done, and avowed herself unacquainted with the principle
on which the arrangement was founded. He
went home, lay for hours awake during the night,
worked all the cards in the pack over and over again
mentally; before morning he had not only discovered
the arrangement, but extended the principle so as to be
applicable, not to twenty-seven cards only, but to any
number within the fifty-two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Punctuality was another marked feature of Mr.
Roby's character. He was, to use his own phrase, "a
timist." An amusing instance of this occurs in his
tour. "Whilst resting and enjoying our cheer (at the
Hospice T&ecirc;te Noir) I surprised Urlaub the courier, by
telling him I had fixed three or four months previously
to cross the T&ecirc;te Noir on this very day, and on this
very hour, showing him a sketch of my tour as given
in the introductory chapter. He said it would serve
him to tell and boast about all his life, he could not
have thought it possible; 'but,' continued he with
great simplicity, 'I am sure they cannot believe me!'"
Other instances equally diverting he would tell, till
even punctuality itself lost its sober character, and
became tinged with mirth, if not romance.</p>

<p>His love of order and arrangement was very great:
it almost amounted to a passion. As soon as a botanical
or conchological work came into his hands, he made
himself master of its contents, and drew out a tabular
view of the information it afforded, a mode of arranging
knowledge of which he was particularly fond, enriching
the book with what might be wanting, and with references
to other standard works. To those who are commencing
such pursuits, a little more detail may perhaps
afford some useful hints. In Lee's botany of the Malvern
Hills, are added, in a beautifully distinct small
hand, to each plant named, a reference to the page of
Hooker's British Flora, on which it is described, and
the month of flowering; while on blank leaves inserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
at the end for the purpose, a list is given of all the plants
according to the time at which they flower, thus forming
a flora for each month in that district, to guide his
search in each day's ramble. In his copies of Sowerby's
English Botany and Hooker's Flora, respectively, to
each plant the page on which it is to be found in the
other work, its number in the London Catalogue, and
synonymes from either of these or from any other high
authority are added, with a mark against each successive
specimen added to his own herbarium. His mode
of laying down and preserving specimens for a progressive
collection of British plants, often excited the
admiration of other collectors. His cabinet of shells,
too, was arranged in his own perfect manner. Yet with
all this order there was nothing merely mechanical in
his character, nothing that hindered the free play of
his imagination.</p>

<p>The medical profession had at one period been contemplated
for him, and his studies for a short time lay
in that direction. For physiological investigations he
always entertained a decided partiality. Hence no
doubt his ready appreciation of the general principles
of hydropathy; he saw and approved the rationale of
the system, before he so successfully tested its practice.
He had cultivated that general knowledge of the
physical sciences which enabled him to trace their
mutual relations. He dwelt with peculiar delight on
their points of intersection, where the mysterious connection
which is ever running underground, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
throughout nature, rises to the surface. His industry
and perseverance equalled the activity of his mind, and
the versatility of his talents. Concentrating his attention
on one subject for the time, when he left it he
would turn with the same fixed concentration to another;
and the ease with which he resumed any design or
train of thought, however long it had been laid aside,
prevented his losing ground that had once been gained.
The quickness with which he acquired knowledge was
remarkable; while the use he would make of a new
discovery or of fresh light cast on an old subject, by
way of illustration, by elucidating kindred truths in
other sciences, or by indicating discoveries yet to be
made, was most happy. Nothing seemed lost upon
him: a fact became to him something more than a bare
fact, an index of the ideal, or of the hidden paths to
those mysterious relations of nature, which it has been
observed were such favourite objects of contemplation.
By no means what is termed a great reader, he usually
preferred scientific works to those of general literature.
He seemed not to care to follow the imaginations of
others; he rather required facts as material for his own
to revel in, and create from. Genius must touch the
earth to gather strength for her flights.</p>

<p>His love of the fine arts partook of the enthusiasm of
his nature. His taste was highly cultivated, and his
own proficiency in several branches of art, of no mean
order. He loved to dwell on the subtle and mysterious
meanings of music, on its wondrous suggestive power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and its burden of associations. A few specimens of his
own power of creating "concord of sweet sounds," have
been preserved. He was particularly happy in adapting
the music to the words or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Sometimes he
would compose an air to one of his own songs. Very
few of these compositions have had the care bestowed
on them necessary to prepare them for publication.
One which was harmonised by Mr. Novello, and published
in the Congregational and Chorister's Psalm and
Hymn Book, will appear in the present volume. It is
a fair specimen of the composer's power of expressing
the higher feelings.</p>

<p>His facility of versification one may almost be
tempted to regret. He would have written better, and
perhaps oftener, had he gone to it as a more severe
task&mdash;yet there are some lines of such exquisite
music and sentiment, the inspiration of the moment,
in his occasional pieces, which no gathering up of
his powers could have enabled him to reach. The
ballads in the traditions afford illustrations of this
remark.</p>

<p>Mr. Roby's skill as a draughtsman was often the
admiration of his friends. His landscape drawings
from nature even when they are faithful as portraits
are always <i>pictures</i>. His fondness for investigation,
the "Inquisitive wants to know" of childhood aided
him here. He was never satisfied until he had found
out the reason why an object takes a known appearance
under given circumstances, or why certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
processes or touches, transfer certain effects. The
writer recollects his mentioning a conversation with
the late B. R. Haydon in which the point under
discussion was, why when an object is presented
against the sky, for example the belly of a horse
standing on an eminence, the sky where it approaches
the object, though in point of fact as blue there as in
any other part, should not be so represented, but in a
dim grey, almost neutral tint. (The reader will at
once perceive, that the blue sky and black horse would
be a tea-tray painting.) The discussion terminated
without any satisfactory result, but Mr. Roby could
not rest till he had found the true reason in the simple
fact, that the eye suiting its focus to the distance of
the object to which it is directed, <i>can not distinctly see,
at the same time, objects at different distances</i>. When
the focus was right for the horse, it would only perceive
the sky indistinctly, or directed to the sky, the
retina would not receive so distinct an image of the
horse. Hence if both were represented exactly as
they are in themselves, instead of as they are seen in
combination, a harsh, unnatural, and therefore false
picture would be the result.</p>

<p>His conversation on art was rich in such remarks.
A lady who drew in water colours from nature in a
superior style observed to the writer, that she had
gained more valuable information from Mr. Roby
than from any of the best masters of whom she had
been in the habit of taking lessons: he had put her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
into possession of <i>principles</i>. Another friend, who was
in raptures with Ruskin's "Modern Painters," described
it as "like hearing Mr. Roby talk." And here again,
in art as in science, he delighted to seek out those
general principles, which, common to all, constitute
the oneness of Art, and to trace their relation to the
human mind.</p>

<p>To his ardent admiration of nature reference has
already been made. That term but partially conveys
an idea of his quick and vivid perception of beauty
under whatever form it appeared, and of the intense
pleasure, one might almost say happiness, of which he
was susceptible from it. His spirit seemed to feed
upon it as Schiller's Pegasus on the breath of flowers.
He would stand entranced before a beautiful object
or hang over it as if by some spell he could draw its
beauty into his own soul. It seemed as though for
pleasure or suffering his mind was in close contact
with the <i>spirit</i> of outward things. Nor was this high
gratification, a thing of rare occurrence. One of
Hogarth's lines of Beauty, so abundantly scattered
through his world who has eyes to see them, sufficed.
He possessed too in a high degree the power of imparting
to others the pleasure he thus enjoyed. His
enthusiasm caught by sympathy communicated in
part to his companions the vividness of his own impressions.
A friend, herself most highly gifted, in
writing of him says, "What true pleasure I feel in
recalling the beauties and excellencies of his character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
in tracing through all his gifts, the upward tendency
of his mind which ever looked</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'From Nature up to Nature's <span class="smcap">God</span>,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which sought His glory in all the pursuits of science&mdash;not
<i>earthly</i> but <i>heavenly</i> pursuits to him&mdash;a mind
to which was not denied the power to gaze along any
one of those shining paths, which unite our mortal
with our immortal nature, to which music, and poetry,
and art and science opened their divinest treasures,
fitting his nature for the immortal joys they whisper
of here!"</p>

<p>It has been occasionally regretted that his powers
were directed to so many objects instead of being
concentrated, so as to secure higher excellence in one
department. And truly were this short life all man's
existence, the end of his progress, and "earthly immortality"
the only "life beyond this," then it might be
to be deplored, if aught would be worth deploring.
But regret vanishes when we consider that in this
case there were only so many more starting points,
for the soul in her higher state of existence, already
made out in this life.</p>

<p>Talents so versatile, it may be believed rendered
their possessor the ornament of general society. They
were at the same time combined with exterior advantages,
graceful movement resulting from a well-proportioned
and finely-moulded form, elegant manner,
so much vivacity, and withal so much gentleness&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
graceful courtesies of life well became him. His
conversational powers were seldom equalled. He
had always the right word at command whatever
might be the topic, while the ever-varying tones of
his musical voice lent additional force to every sentiment
whether mirthful or pathetic. Information,
anecdote, humour were by turns elicited. It was
easy, as it was pleasant, to converse with him; he
never misapprehended; he seemed to know what others
were going to say, their ideas were his, and the prompt
rejoinder made, by a kind of social electricity. Conversation
never flagged when he was present; a sullen
silence was his abhorrence; equally so, a monotonous
abuse of the weather, roads, &amp;c. His never-failing
humour, and love of pleasantry or kind-hearted banter,
supplied the place of Rousseau's expedient of weaving
lace-strings, when in company where it was difficult,
if not impossible to maintain conversation that would
interest the whole party. If occasionally his repartees
gave offence, no one was more ready to apologise
or to atone to any feeling that had been wounded.
In truth, nothing was farther from his intention than
giving pain, but his love of humour once excited, he
did not pause to look from another's point of view.
It was as impossible for him to refrain from enjoying
a joke if it told against himself, as if it bore on another&mdash;in
fact, if it were really a good one, the being
pointed against himself seemed rather to enhance the
piquancy. So conscious was he of the absence of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
ill-natured feeling, that it was difficult for him to
realize how any one could be hurt by those sallies which,
coming from another, he would perfectly understand.
A lady who was often the subject of his sportive
railleries, observed, that no one who saw the kind
expression of his eye could feel wounded. It was
after a time of close mental application that his
sportive qualities came out the most strongly; it
seemed to be a necessary relief, and the rebound
involved mirthfulness in many of its innocent forms.
Practical jokes he never allowed either in himself or
others; nor did his humour ever degenerate into
mimicry, or amusement at the expense of the absent;
delicacy of feeling forbad that. A sharp contest of
wits such as he designated "cut and come again" was
his great delight. D'Israeli the elder remarks, "One
peculiar trait in the conversation of men of genius
which has often injured them, when the listeners
were not intimately acquainted with the man, are
certain sports of a vacant mind, a sudden impulse to
throw out opinions and take views of things in some
humour of the moment." Something akin to this
Mr. Roby occasionally indulged in, if he perceived
that any one had formed a false idea of his character,
which was not unfrequently the case, he would find
a passing diversion in helping on the mistake. How
this comported with that yearning for sympathy, which
was one of the master passions of his nature, it is
not difficult to explain. Finding out by intuition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
where he was not understood, he sought in the amusement
of watching the effect of the character thus
thrust upon him, on those who had given it, a refuge
from the pain which the discovery of the utter absence
of sympathy could not but inflict. Afford him but
a ray of this coveted sympathy, and you made his
happiness, and your own by reflection. Intercourse
with the world had taught him how rarely the finer
feelings or higher sentiments are responded to, and
a shrinking from their exposure in his own case led
him to conceal them under the light robe of pleasantry.
Hence he was sometimes suspected of want of earnestness
by those who, as D'Israeli remarks, "were not
intimately acquainted with the man."</p>

<p>His fund of general information contributed to the
charm of his conversational powers, for with him
knowledge was as ready to hand as it was various.
It seemed to spring spontaneously at the sight of any
thing with which it could be associated. Memory
while she held her treasures with a firm hand, generously
shared them with the companion of the walk
or the acquaintance of the social hour. At the same
time there was no assumption, no affectation of superiority
in his manner: it was perfectly natural and
simple.</p>

<p>Possessing great musical talent, a fine ear, and the
power of modulating his voice so as to blend with
others, and the still rarer gift of composing a part
extempore to any melody, his assistance was sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
as a valuable acquisition in social music. Before his
illness his whistle was singularly rich, and he frequently
used it as an accompaniment. The writer
never heard it; but a gentleman referring to an evening
spent in his society many years since, thus describes it,
"I never heard human whistle so clear, so distinct,
and brilliant: it was like a flute."<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps what he was in general society may be
best shown by the impression he made on acquaintances
of various tastes and habits whom from time to
time he casually met. Among the many tributes of
respect to his memory and to "his sterling qualities
both of heart and mind," which the writer has received,
one or two may be selected bearing on the
salient points of his character. A recent friend, who
with his lady were the last guests who were staying
with him before he left Malvern for Scotland,
writes, "I cannot let this opportunity pass without
offering my humble tribute of respect to your late
husband's memory. My acquaintance with Mr. Roby
was, as you are aware, of brief duration, but I can
most unaffectedly, and with sincere gratitude say, that
during that period, I learned much of him&mdash;more than
I ever learned in my life from any single person. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
was impossible to be with him without catching something
of his earnestness and enthusiasm. Would he
had been spared! His death was a severe loss to me.
I had hoped to enjoy his society during the coming
summer, to mature in his company those tastes which,
if he did not infuse into me, he certainly roused from
their dormancy. But this was not to be! Like all
who ever came into contact with him, I was struck,
on my introduction to Mr. Roby, by the variety of
his acquirements, then by their elegant intellectual
character. His energy in the acquisition of knowledge
had amassed a great store of material for intellectual
enjoyment&mdash;his wonderful "<i>order</i>" had arranged it in
the happiest and most available manner. I think I
never in my life saw a man of greater mental activity.
<i>He had no lounging moments.</i> And yet I saw but the
<i>relaxation</i> of his mind."</p>

<p>One who knew him intimately the last two years
of his life remarks, "Few persons I should imagine
could have been in Mr. Roby's society without feeling
a peculiar charm, a gladdening influence, which made
life appear bright and genial. Intercourse with him,
invariably gave me a sense of power: this made me
from the first recognise him as a man of genius. A
magician in the regions of the ideal himself, he
seemed to inspire his listener with the same mastery
over its elements. Whatever might be the topic
under notice, it stood out with new beauty as he
handled it. His conversation, enriched from a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
sources, sparkled like the many facets of the well-cut
diamond."</p>

<p>A very old friend who ranks among the first
dramatists of the day in speaking of intercourse in
years long since departed, characterised him as "a
man of rich imagination, and the warmest and soundest
heart." Adding in confirmation of the latter trait,
"I was a perfect stranger when he received me as a
brother, and took on himself the entire management of a
course of lectures which I delivered in Rochdale several
years ago, and which proved to be very remunerative
chiefly through his cordially-exerted influence."</p>

<p>Another in writing of him, after dwelling with
affectionate admiration on other traits of character,
notices "his great good nature and kindness of heart,
particularly the good-humoured manner in which he
bore the expression of opinions different from his own,
which by many would not have been taken so patiently.
The extreme versatility of his talents placed
at his command, acquirements the most varied, such
as few persons attain to, and his kind and agreeable
manner of imparting the knowledge he possessed was
equally remarkable. His talent and exquisite humour
in relating one of his stories or an old tradition, I
can scarcely imagined to have been equalled."</p>

<p>Several friends have remarked that during their last
interview with him, the conversation turned to the
highest subjects, in some cases terminating by a short
striking remark on his part, too valuable to be forgotten.
A slight instance of this occurred in his last conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
with the friend just quoted. It happened to be on a
subject often discussed before,&mdash;art in connection with
religion as exemplified in the fine old ecclesiastical
structures of our country. No one possessed a deeper
sense of their beauty than himself, but his mind at the
same time comprehended the possibility of losing sight
of the spiritual in admiration of the material, and at the
close of the conversation, his last words were, "Well
good bye, remember <i>we must not worship wood and
stone</i>." The aptness of the remark, the tone in which
it was uttered, fixed it in the memory of the listener,
and it is now treasured as a parting warning. There is
a sacred pleasure in dwelling on conversations like
these, involving high moral truths, elements of the intercourse
yet to be renewed.</p>

<p>It was always in a circle narrower than that of
general society, that he was seen to most advantage.
When he felt he was surrounded only by those of congenial
tastes he came out truly himself. His conversation
then flowed without any restraint, he blended the
ideal with the real in a way that showed a spirit gifted</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To pierce the mist o'er life's deep meanings spread."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A distinguished essayist of the present century compares
himself to those toys which we sometimes see
formed of box within box. His outer character he
tells us was visible to all; to friends in proportion to
their intimacy he threw off case after case; the sight of
the innermost was reserved for himself, or for only one
other. So here too was a narrower circle within that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of closest friendship, where one more covering cast
aside, his character displayed itself without any reserve.
What he might have been to the <i>valet</i> "who looked at
him with valet eyes," the writer knows not, but by
one to whom that character was bared as to none
besides, so far from seeming any less from the intimate
acquaintance of daily life, its true nobleness was only
then fully recognised. It is not every character that
bears the near scrutiny afforded by insight through the
little things of life. Fewer still grow "right worshipful"
under such inspection. <i>He</i> did both. His feelings
repressed, as we have seen in childhood, he had not been
in the habit of expressing them freely to the objects of
his affection. The writer learned far more of the
strength of his love for his children, from remarks he
made when alone with her, and from the regard he paid
to the effect which any step he took might have on
their welfare, than from any ordinary demonstrations
to them. The anxiety he evinced during the first
holidays his boys spent with her, that she should understand
them, and the pains he took to draw out the
most interesting points of their characters, told more
forcibly than words, his concern for their happiness.
Though he rarely joined in their amusements himself,
yet the quiet delight with which he would stand and
watch when she happened to do anything of the kind
showed how dear even their pleasures were to him.</p>

<p>It has been a common reproach against literary men,
that they are undesirable companions in private life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
prone to betray unworthy jealousy of the talents of
those around them; though brilliant in society, fretful
or unsocial at home. Here was one more added to the
many examples of the contrary. Neither mirth nor
talents, courtesy nor generous feeling, nor any thing
that adorns or makes life happy, was reserved like
holiday attire for going abroad. One who though
admitting he could not brook defeat at his favourite
chess, from any other lady, would yet say he should
have lost the game to his wife with pleasure, because he
should feel her triumph his own, could not have been
an undesirable home companion.</p>

<p>It is by trifles such as these, that what the gifted are
in private life is seen. That it may not invariably be
thus is admitted, but the solution is easy. Fireside
happiness depends not on the presence or absence of
talent, but on the harmony of natural disposition, character,
and taste. Genius neither commands this, nor
can supply its deficiency. It only renders its possessor
more keenly alive to the want of congeniality, and
those around perchance more wretched from the conscious
lack of power to make its happiness. The man of
genius may not only make home the most blessed spot
on earth, but with the blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span> give a brilliancy
and an intensity to domestic happiness, which none
besides can; peopling the wastes of every day life, with
bright thoughts that never die, till little is left of
mortal existence, that is not to be continued in the
higher life to come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>But there were yet higher endowments&mdash;talents are
but as the beautiful lamp, spiritual life the light they
enshrine; and when that light glows with an intensity,
that throws out the fair form, and exquisitely-moulded
figures, till the very lamp becomes brilliant, a light-giving
thing, then indeed is it a vessel "fit for the
Master's use," to the glory of His name whose <i>workmanship</i>
the lamp is, but whose <i>breath</i> the light within.
And that to all the rich gifts already described, was
added that which is pre-eminently <span class="smcap">the gift of god</span>,
even "Eternal Life through Christ Jesus our Lord,"
is the point of deepest interest. Taught as we have
seen by the discipline of suffering, his were the convictions
of experience, not those of the understanding
merely; he felt throughout his whole nature, his utter
powerlessness to erect himself into a consciously virtuous
being, and he felt as strongly that in the salvation
of Christ alone was that which at once bringing pardon
and imparting holiness, meets all the deep-seated wants
of our nature, and raises us to the dignity of "sons and
daughters of the Lord Almighty." With a heart
thrilling to its very centre with a sense of unutterable
need, he clung to the promises of the Gospel. And as
time advanced and the hidden life grew stronger, and
daily intercourse united the spirit more closely to <span class="smcap">God</span>
as its Father, through faith in Christ Jesus, his character
assumed more and more of the likeness of that
blessed state which it has now entered. Deep humility
and self-distrust habitually marked his religion. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
letter dated April 1849, after detailing a circumstance
which occurred during a short stay at Clifton, very
gratifying to him as an author, he adds "I may say all
this to <i>you</i> because you understand me.... But I
feel it is not safe to <i>indulge</i> in it. A momentary glance
at one's position&mdash;and then back again into the only
safe place,&mdash;low at the Master's feet in love and humiliation,
'What hast thou, that thou hast not received?'"
"I am so afraid of <i>myself</i>" was an expression he often
used in the most intimate conversation. He felt it was
only by the daily impartation of a strength greater than
his own, that spiritual life was sustained. All those
sentiments in the inspired writings, which ordinarily to
the men of the world, are either mysteries or meaningless
phrases, now comprehended in the fulness of their
truth, had become the utterances of his own soul.
"The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the
<span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>, who loved me and gave Himself for me."
He went to the scriptures for his code of morality, as
well as for the promise of the life to come. Never
under any circumstances did he shrink from performing
what he considered to be Christian duty, or from avowing
what he believed to be religious truth. The tone
of Cowper's hymns harmonised more with the prevailing
cast of his mind than that of any other sacred lyrics.
Those of them which are to be found in Lady Huntingdon's
collection, were associated with his earliest
recollections, and when his spirit was all unconsciously
preparing itself for a speedy and unlooked-for summons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
into the immediate presence of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the strains of the
poet, who so emphatically learned "in suffering" what
he taught "in song," cheered and animated one kindred
in spirit, as in faith. There is something pleasant in
the thought that the strains which his mother might
have sung by his cradle, were the latest given forth
by his own rich voice.</p>

<p>While lowliness of mind before God, and a constant
desire to serve his fellow-men, were perhaps the most
conspicuous features of his religious character, the over-flowings
of a grateful spirit must not be overlooked.
Thanksgiving formed an essential part of his religion;
neither the simple pleasures nor the richer blessings
of life were lost upon him. Day by day he seemed
as though he would never be thankful enough. His
recognition of the hand of <span class="smcap">God</span> in all he enjoyed
was very vivid.</p>

<p>How far back the religious element of his character
may be traced, it is impossible to say. The human
mind is susceptible of the fear of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and doubtless
the actions may be modified thereby, long before any
distinct consecration to his service, or, which must
ordinarily precede it, that true self-knowledge which
makes the need of a Saviour felt. That best of
blessings the example of a Christian life in his parents,
was around his earliest days, so that his first ideas
of right and wrong must have taken a Christian tone.
And that as he rose into life, the claims of a Creator
and Saviour on his love and service occupied his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
attention, the writer is aware. Never indeed will be
forgotten the intensity of feeling with which, within
the last twelvemonths of his life he would sometimes
refer to one among his youthful associates, who at that
early period encouraged him in the practice of spiritual
duties. He knew what a life passed amid the stir of
the world was, how the hot noon dries up the current
of early feeling, and the thorns of care choke the
hidden life; and vivid anxiety for his friend's spiritual
state, mingled with the grateful remembrance of forty
years ago. A sentiment which now burst forth fresher
than ever, because he knew as he had never done before,
from what the salvation of <span class="smcap">God</span> is a deliverance.</p>

<p>His sympathy for others in a religious point of
view was very strong; the deep pity, amounting to
personal grief, which he has expressed in intimate
conversation, when speaking of any whose life or
avowed principles, testified they were "without hope,
and without <span class="smcap">God</span> in the world," showed that his religion
drew him the nearer to all his race. Strongly as
principle and feeling alike led him to seek to promote
in any way in his power the highest good of his fellow-creatures,
the remembrance of his deep spiritual
suffering caused him to take a deeper interest in those
whose minds were in any degree agonised and bewildered
as his had been. He would have considered
no amount of mental effort or physical fatigue too
great to encounter, could he thereby have "ministered
to a mind diseased." In 1848 when visiting friends in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the south of England, he was told of a poor old woman
whose distress of mind had baffled every attempt to
relieve it. He went to her cottage, sat down and
listened to her complaints, anticipating them in great
measure from his own vividly-remembered distress.
She was cheered by finding another, who could tell
beforehand what she was going to say; and when he
reached down the Bible, and began reading his own
favourite passages, "When the poor and needy seek
water and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst,
I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will hear them, I the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Israel will
not forsake them, I will open rivers in high places and
fountains in the midst of the valleys" &amp;c., and entering
into her feelings, showed her that the glorious promises
of God were made to the wretched and self-condemning,
light seemed to burst upon her mind, and
her thankfulness and delight knew no bounds; and
second only to hers, were his own.&mdash;The most brilliant
success in society had never afforded a pleasure like this.
He seldom referred to his own past suffering, when he did
so it was in a brief but touching manner: thus in a
letter dated March 1849 he writes, "Pray give my
very best remembrance to Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; and tell her that
when I come to &mdash;&mdash; I <i>intend</i> sitting once more in her
arm chair, now with what different feelings. I had
not then found 'a hiding place from the storm, and
a covert from the tempest.' Now however I hope I
have found Christ as 'the shadow of a great rock in
a weary land.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The true lowliness of spirit and willingness to be
set aside, with which he commenced any undertaking,
evinced a chastened spirit, which showed that he had
not suffered in vain. "How thankful," wrote he to
a friend, "we ought to be that we are permitted even
to attempt any thing for Him <i>who has given us all</i>, and
though apparently we fail, yet, as you say, we are
secure from disappointment; and, depend on it, some
good will arise probably to ourselves, if not to others,
from our least efforts; at any rate, if they lead us to
more humility and dependence on Him, one great end
will have been answered." And two months later,
writing to the same friend, he observed:&mdash;"It does
seem part of the discipline of life that we should aim
at duty&mdash;just embark in what seems the very path
we ought to pursue for our own and other's good,
and then plainly be sent back to learn one very
important lesson we are too apt to forget,&mdash;viz. that
the great Master can do his work without us."<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>In a letter dated February 22nd, 1850, after
speaking of the happiness he had enjoyed of late in
communion with <span class="smcap">God</span>, and expressing his desire to
serve Him, especially by comforting "the weary," he
adds, "but they 'do His will who only stand and wait;'
I am watching the course of events, and when <span class="smcap">He</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
has work for me to do, I shall be appointed to it.
In the meantime I am working with my pen what
may be useful at one time or another."</p>

<p>The repose which belongs to maturity of character,
indicated by the last extract, was not unnoticed at
the time. It was one of those traits then marked,
but now fully understood. Many things which the
writer took for philosophic superiority to trifles, and
admired as such at the time, she now recognises as
Christian elevation of character. There was about
him an air&mdash;not exactly of indifference to the world
or of separation from it, for he entered with zest into
the social pleasures and all the higher pursuits of life&mdash;but
of something like a consciousness of still nobler
relations than any which connected his spirit with
earth, an abiding recognition of a world to which he
more properly belonged and still better than this which
he so much enjoyed; and he seemed to stand with one
foot uplifted ready to enter on that not distant world.
It was a fulfilling of the divine precept, "Let your
loins be girded about, and your lights burning, and
ye yourselves like unto men waiting for their Lord."</p>

<p>An intimate friend when referring to daily intercourse
with him, enjoyed for some time during the last
autumn of his life, writes: "The advance in all things
connected with the spiritual good of himself, or of
others, was very striking&mdash;there was a dignity of deportment,
a seriousness when treating of divine things,
and an anxious desire for the religious improvement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
all whom he could influence, that, superadded to his
natural cheerfulness and lively wit, made him a most
delightful companion. Still this increase of grace was
chiefly preparing him for the approaching removal: he
was taken because he was <i>ready</i>. Never did a bed of
languishing sickness more evidently fit the sufferer for
'going home' than did his beautiful frame of mind
during the happy months that preceded his sudden
removal." Not better chosen could one expression of
the above have been, had the writer of the note recollected
Mr. Roby's crest&mdash;a sheaf of corn (<i>garb</i>), and
motto "<span class="smcap">I am ready</span>." Rapid had the ripening been&mdash;those
years of suffering had done their work and
the brief, but bright, sunshine that followed, made
the sheaf ready for the garner.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>The mind lingers on this aspect of his character.
Most precious to dwell upon now is&mdash;not the memory
of his rich talents&mdash;not the recollection of his warm
and generous affection, which, like the sunset glow, invests
all connected with him, with a brightness that
seems as if it would never grow dim, but&mdash;the thought
that he was, in the true, not merely in the conventional,
sense of the word, a <span class="smcap">Christian</span>. This alone can connect
the beloved ones who are "gone home" with all
that is real in comfort.&mdash;The workings of the sorrowful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
heart are no longer vague guesses and fruitless longings,
but sure and living hopes founded on "the true sayings
of <span class="smcap">God</span>." And when the voice whose music stirred the
very depths of the soul, as none other had power to
do, can be no longer heard, the ear of the spirit is
quickened for voiceless intercourse. And since those
sayings assure us that those whom we call the dead
still live, in all the integrity of their spiritual being, we
feel that they can scarcely be said to be gone&mdash;that the
one in spirit are one for eternity&mdash;that their love for,
and interest in us are not shaken&mdash;and if neither ear
nor eye can catch sound or glimpse of what was dearer
than life, still we are not without tokens of their presence.
The intercourse of spirit with spirit is not
destroyed because one veil of flesh is dropped; rather
it is so much the nearer. The flow of reciprocated
affection, the joy as truly shared, and sorrow as
tenderly lightened with whispered assurances of sympathy,
all tell of an union over which death hath no
power. Henceforward no abiding sense of loneliness,
can weigh down the heart made strong in an affection
which,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Doth draw the very soul into itself,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and brings it into companionship with "the spirits of
just men made perfect" in the presence of their Father
and our Father. All that remains for earth is "the
Patience of Hope." Death to the survivor as well as to
his victim has "lost his sting." Thanks be unto <span class="smcap">God</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>Thus faintly and inadequately have been pourtrayed
the life and character of one whom his Maker had
endowed with genius, and sent forth for life's brief day.
His appointed task was to go to his fellow men, when
the fever of earth's turmoil is on them, and, by transporting
them into other scenes, to charm away their
cares and weariness for a while; bringing one character
after another, and adventures in quick succession,
before the reader, till he rises refreshed, and with new
spirit goes forth again to the conflict of life; having
found too, during his brief sojourn in that ideal region,
many a hint of valuable information, many a true moral
principle.</p>

<p>And if increasing light from that world towards
which he was so rapidly advancing showed him how
more distinctly to place before his fellow men the characteristic
truths of Christianity as the foundation of all
that is good and enduring, and to consecrate his talents
to the highest interests of mankind, and then, with all
his plans and purposes ripening, <span class="smcap">God</span> called him away,
it was only to enter on worthier labours in that world,
where "His servants serve Him day and night." Strange
as such a cutting short of a life so lately renewed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
physical vigour, and devoted to the high service of <span class="smcap">God</span>
appears, the very suddenness was in keeping with the
whole tenor of an existence which knew no idle moments&mdash;as
if not an hour of such a spirit was to be wasted&mdash;to-day
working here in the full vigour of his mortal
life, to-morrow on the other side of death, an immortal
spirit serving in its appointed rank before the
throne of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>Sense would fain follow, and, amid the shadowy
forms of that world, catch a sight of one so dear: but
the eye is strained in vain. Yet Faith can hear her
Father's voice: "<span class="smcap">Blessed</span> are the dead that die in the
Lord," and she is content: for "<span class="smcap">they shall hunger
no more, neither thirst any more; neither
shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.
for the lamb which is in the midst of the
throne shall feed them, and shall lead them
unto living fountains of waters, and god shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes</span>."</p>

<h2>THE FIRST REVELATION.</h2>


<p>Suggested by the story of a child, whose father, an educated man, but an
infidel, if not an atheist, had not allowed him to receive any religious
culture. Being one day reproved by a friend for using profane language,
on the ground that it was displeasing to <span class="smcap">God</span>, he enquired who was meant.
He instantly apprehended with delight all that was told him of the nature
and attributes of the Supreme Being, as if the idea had been latent in his
mind, until thus called forth into recognised existence.</p>

Hermione again visits my house.&mdash;<br />
Your presence, good my lord, with your fair dame,<br />
I would solicit.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">duke.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Well, Ridolfi, be it so:&mdash;to-day,</span><br />
If nought forbid the time:&mdash;Hermione,<br />
Thou say'st?&mdash;I do remember, yet so slight, 'tis scarce<br />
The shadow of her form. But once, my brother,<br />
'Twas one fair summer's eve, awhile I saw<br />
Thy sprightly coz: a laughter-loving spirit,<br />
She threw quick mirth as the unbidden shafts<br />
Of innocent love, scattering with hand profuse<br />
Her joyous pranks. I was but newly wedded,<br />
Scarce past the honey-moon; Beatrice hung<br />
Fondly upon mine arm, and we too laugh'd,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>On that still night, until the whisp'ring woods<br />
Grew loud, and thousand voices started forth<br />
From bough and hoary stem, bursting as if<br />
To riotous life; and yet her giddy face,<br />
Playful and changing as the restless wave,<br />
I cannot fashion now from memory's storehouse&mdash;<br />
How fares thy cousin?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">ridolfi.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Still by love, my lord,</span><br />
She comes untamed; but time, one delicate shade<br />
Hath slightly pass'd upon her wanton mirth,<br />
Softening the ruder bursts of her high spirit,<br />
Tinged ofttime now with gentler thought.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">duke.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">'Tis well</span><br />
When ripening years mellow the gaudy hue<br />
Of youth's rich fancies, sparkling else too bright<br />
For its repose.&mdash;&mdash;We visit thee to-day.&mdash;<br />
This tribute say we give Hermione.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">ridolfi.</span></span><br />
Much honour hold we from your presence:<br />
Our poorer hospitality excuse,<br />
As you are wont. Adieu! No costly feast<br />
We give, but our glad welcome.<span style="margin-left: 8em;">                       [<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">duke.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">A brother still,&mdash;a friend</span><br />
To cheer my way through life's dark wilderness.<br />
Thou art a feeble light, and yet I love<br />
To watch thy tremulous blaze, blessing the gloom,<br />
And shedding round my path its thousand gems,<br />
Sprinkling perchance some loathed and hideous form<br />
With thy pale gleam. How tender hast thou been<br />
To my worst weaknesses, my foibles, all<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Heart-withering cares! Though born to humbler honours,<br />
I call thee friend. Well hast thou earn'd from me<br />
That sacred name! One bosom nourish'd us:<br />
One hand our childhood rear'd; twining we grew<br />
Unto one stem, till riches and high birth<br />
Bore me brief space from that beloved soil,&mdash;<br />
That home, to which our very nature yet<br />
Seems most akin.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Of proud descent, unsullied as mine own,<br />
Thou yet canst boast: if not of titled wealth,<br />
Of outward garb, thy suit becomes thee well;<br />
And I do love thee more than if array'd<br />
In ducal coronet. Beatrice too<br />
Hath prized him for my sake, and her esteem<br />
I do repay with tenfold love.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Fierce, feverish love!&mdash;thine idle dreams,&mdash;fleeting<br />
As cloud-fed vapour, yon o'erarching bow<br />
Bestrides,&mdash;fade as the sunbeam on the sky<br />
Dispels the glowing mist. 'Tis well, if then<br />
The welkin clear'd, each circumstance and form,&mdash;<br />
Fashion'd realities by truth impress'd<br />
Upon the craving eye-balls,&mdash;O 'tis well<br />
If on these fix'd and palpable images<br />
Of roused and wakening sense, the eye may rest<br />
With unappeased delight! But if the while<br />
Love's light-wing'd visions fade, nought fills the void<br />
Save chilling wastes, trackless, unlimited,<br />
That echo back their own grim desolation<br />
To the appalled spirit. What escape<br />
The shrinking soul is left, save one dark path<br />
To unappointed death? I thank thee, Heaven,<br />
Thou sparest me this trial! Love hath still<br />
With proud esteem held equal sway: in peace,<br />
Untroubled they divide their several empire.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
But I must hence; Beatrice I would greet<br />
First with these tidings of Hermione.<span style="margin-left: 6em;">                [<i>Exit.</i></span></p>


<h4><br />SCENE II.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>A Hall in the House of Ridolfi.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Servants, preparing for an Entertainment.</i></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Help me with this wine, Stephano.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Help thee? yea, my wishes be thy help. I hope thou
wilt have unhelped speed.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Truce to thy wit, comrade, for it helpeth me not, save
an' my fingers to this cudgel, and thine hide to a basting.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Nay, spare thy wit, and thy cudgel to boot: mine hide
endureth it not tenderly. If I should wince, thou mightest
come to harm. A dainty flagon this: would that thy mouth
were as dry as my lips, and our bellies had changed occupants!
Thy lazy body would be lighter, methinks, and I
better able to carry thee.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
The Lady Hermione! Oh, how I do love her sweet face,
Stephano! She smiles an' it were so temptingly when she
speaks! "Good Roland," says she, "give me of that wine."&mdash;"Kind
Roland, do go to the bath, and carry my little
spaniel:"&mdash;or thus, "Honest master Roland, pray take my
basket, and bring me thy master's garden mittens." This
house, I trow, Stephano, she makes like to some gay palace,
when she visits it; as pleasant and full of goodness as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>Duke's pantry, who comes to the feast to-day. She was here
some two years agone, and I thought I should have pined
away at heart when she left.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Tush! thou star-stricken marmoset! Is she not a woman?
Are not all women as full of deceit as their grandmothers?
Is not Eve's flesh upon the bones of the very best jade in
Christendom? and this blowzy-bell of thine, beshrew me,
has no better a covering than the rest of 'em. This dainty
hoyden thou delightest to worship, man, can be as chary of
her winning looks as any of her sisterhood; and if I have
not seen a storm brewing in her face, I have seen a water-spout
in her eye, marry, which is almost fathomless. Mark
me, Roland; if any good comes of her mummery, I am no
true prophet, that's all.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Envious in this, I do guess, Stephano. Why does she not
smile on thee&mdash;eh? Thy stupid face, seamed like a beggar's
coat; thy marvellous bright eyes and small nostrils; or,
mayhap, I might the rather mean, thy marvellous bright
nostrils and small eyes, make tears come into her delicate
organs by sympathy, like the stroke of a dull razor. I tell
thee, man, she cannot smile fronting thy mis-shapened countenance.
I know many gentlewomen that bear not an ugly
serving-man about them; and the delicate Hermione, I
should bethink me, hath aversion to such.&mdash;I like her the
better, Stephano, for thine ugliness.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Thou mis-shapen cur, time serves not to correct thee.
What! dost brag if thy grinning leer provoke her mirth?
"Sweet Roland," ah, "good Roland," put thy nose to the
curling irons, and twist thy mouth with thy garters. I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>tell thee, "Master Roland," this favourite hath her privy
counsellors, and she not a wit loth to trust 'em. Ah, ah!
"honest Roland," perhaps thou didst help her to the terrace
key o' yesternight; and it was "kind Roland, fetch me"&mdash;oh,
her pretty spaniel was it, "Master Roland?"</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Nay, thou art in jest. Sawest thou the Lady Hermione
with the key last night?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
I heard a noise in the gallery, and I jumped hastily from
my mattress, and who should I see but Hermione, with her
chamber-lamp, opening the door which leads to the garden
terrace. What sayest thou, Roland?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
The key I fetched not.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Then, it seems, she lacks not other "honest" friends for
matters of more need, and they in nothing loth to serve her.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Didst thou watch her further?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Ay, good Roland, or I do not deserve to know the worth
of a pretty secret.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Well?&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Thou art curious, i' faith. What makes thee look so
wistful?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Come, thou lucky knave, I want the burden of thy song.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>How sped she?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
I hied me to the topmost lattice, overlooking&mdash;</p>

Who was the gallant?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Why truly he had a brighter face than thine own, but
shorn off somewhat from the left cheek.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
Thou speakest parables, Stephano. Out with it, friend:
a secret cometh to no good if kept in thy stomach.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
A fair face; eyes, mouth, and nose, though none of the
best;&mdash;I think not half so well made as mine own.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
In troth, a dainty lover. What more?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
But then she gave him such a look of devotion, it would
have done thine heart good to have watched the turn of her
face, and to have looked at the glistening of her eye,&mdash;and
yet this platter-faced gallant seemed all unmoved.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
His name knowest thou?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Verily, he hath many titles, and I should be puzzled to
suit my respect with his proper quality, should we meet.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">roland.</span></span><br />
I'll watch to-night;&mdash;but pr'ythee whisper me his name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>gently; I am not quick at solving a riddle.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">stephano.</span></span><br />
Nay, nay; watch and satisfy thine own prying fancy, as
I have mine. If she walks to-night I'll call thee.<span style="margin-left: 1em;"> [<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

Two years agone&mdash;this self-same chamber&mdash;<br />
Just as 'twas wont;&mdash;that ebony casket&mdash;still<br />
Yon little crucifix hung o'er the mirror,&mdash;<br />
That plaited riband, on its flower-carved pillars,<br />
I wore in sport for love's fair guerdon;<br />
Its chequer'd noose I vow'd to cast on him<br />
Who caught me first in some wild reckless game<br />
Of wanton mirth; but none, as I remember,<br />
The adventure gain'd,&mdash;it hangs unclaim&eacute;d still.<br />
But why this heaviness?&mdash;as if some secret,<br />
Some long-forgotten grief, waked from its slumber,<br />
Roused at the voice of these loud recollections.<br />
Ah! dread dissembler! once I thought thee dead,<br />
And thou but slept! Away! haunt not my spirit!<br />
Is it thy form, fell demon? Hence!&mdash;thy strength<br />
Is nurtured but with present loneliness,<br />
And on the wings of some reviving thought<br />

A billet!&mdash;Welcome!&mdash;Stay.<br />
Thou shalt attire me in some simple garb,<br />
Some unassuming robe; its modest hue<br />
Unnoticed, I can there observe<br />
The humours of this feast.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">blanch.</span></span><br />
Your crimson bodice, lady, becomes you best, and your

orange tiffany dress, and your coif and farthingale?</p>

Neither, good Blanch. Where is mine old spotted robe,
with the silk sleeves and violet-flowered stomacher?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">blanch.</span></span><br />
Lady, what unlucky accident should bethink you of the
garment? I fear your memory is but indifferently served.
Once, my kind mistress, you gave it to me: and I remember
well I said the dress was too gay, when straight you replied,
with a sigh (and I do always grieve to hear you sigh,
lady), "Take it, good Blanch; I wear it not again:" which
I the more marvelled at, being, as you remember, made up
for your last visit to Mantua, nor did you inquire for it,
after you left this gay city; but methinks none other serves
you so well for this same soft-air'd clime. I will away for
it speedily, right glad, I trow, the roguish pedler hath not
fetched it, who gathers the cast-off dresses from your house.
I have not worn the apparel, lady.</p>

suit from my clothes-press, and take it for the exchange.&mdash;Nay,
good Blanch, I allow not thy gainsay:&mdash;it will, peradventure,
help thee to a husband.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">blanch.</span></span><br />
I will but keep it then, my sweet mistress, to answer at
your bidding; mayhap, you will fancy it on your wedding-day.</p>

I shall need no garment then, but the one thy grandmother
wore when she scared thy father in the forest.</p>

'Tis well, good Carlos, in this noble city,<br />
Thanks to all proper instruments, we now<br />
Enter safe housed. Nay, nay, dole-stricken friend,<br />
Put off these looks, drench'd still in woe. Why, man,<br />
Love ne'er was waked with weeping; woman's eye<br />
E'er kept her heart, and thou must henceforth bribe<br />
With gayer looks that restless twinkling organ,<br />
Ere thou may'st gain admittance to her breast.<br />
Rouse thee!&mdash;Accost her thus, with careless look<br />
And laughing eye;&mdash;bid her "good day;"&mdash;<br />
Wring her fair hand; and if withdrawn,<br />
Why seize her by the waist: her sullen looks<br />
Heed not; an' if she chide, toss back her words;&mdash;<br />
Let her not learn from thy woe-tinctured face,<br />
Ere yet the tremulous voice its utterance shape,<br />
Thou pinest a love-sick fool!&mdash;</p>

Love hath not quell'd. I cannot now th' oppressor<br />
Lift from my soul; I am bow'd down,&mdash;subdued,&mdash;<br />
Crush'd even to earth,&mdash;yet crawling heavily,<br />
A cumbrous burden, wearied, useless here,<br />
And without purport to my fellow-men!&mdash;<br />
I seem aloof from all connexion, tie,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Or kindred with mankind. The very earth,<br />
My parent dust, claims not its fellowship<br />
With mine! Would that yon chill and rayless dwelling<br />
Had shut me out, and all mine hated sorrow,<br />
Far from the gaze, the cold, unpitying gaze,<br />
Alike of stranger and of friend!<br />
Soon shall the darkness cover me,&mdash;the tomb<br />
Close mine account for ever. Then shall I rest;&mdash;<br />
No glance of cool-eyed scorn shall meet me there,<br />
Nor woman's charm'd and traitorous tongue shall mock me.<br />

The shadow most he fears.&mdash;I do not mock thee;<br />
Cold scorn lurks not i' the same laughing orbit<br />
Of an unfraudulent eye. Thou know'st it well,<br />
Thy peace alone I've sought; and this coy dame,<br />
Woo'd as mine hopes commend, would free my bosom<br />

Using such vehement passion as doth rouse<br />
The listening heart. Pour thy whole soul to hers:<br />

The warm flood to thine heart. But I forbear:&mdash;<br />
My wish is ever foremost on my tongue,<br />

Unask'd attend, and with some vagrant band<br />
Of hired melodists, at once discourse,<br />
To thine heart's easing, of pale woe, sighs, groans,<br />
And love forsaken. Thus prepared, her thought<br />
Will wondering turn to her moon-driven warbler.<br />
Thou knowest well in woman's restless soul<br />
A lurking fondness lies for mystery.<br />
If thou but win her thought to some connexion,<br />

he will return. Virgin decorum permitteth not my regard
to his first appearance.&mdash;Hark!&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Music.</i>]&mdash;&mdash;Oh! how
my heart flutters! Sweet harbinger of love! I must show
myself, or he will die of despair, or, perchance, he will not
come again, which will suit me still worse. Though, certes,
it would be mightily amusing to feel oneself the cause of a
gay cavalier hanging himself in his garters! What a precious
revenge for the many slights we maidens are subject
to! And then, to have it said, "there goes the signora for
whom signor so and so hanged himself." Oh, how charming
is this moonlight! Really, I am younger to-night than when
I was but one year past thirty. Hush!&mdash;ay, I warrant thou
art in love;&mdash;I can tell by the turn of thy voice. Senor
Antonio quavered just as thou dost;&mdash;but&mdash;he was fickle,
and quavered so far he could not get back again. I never

The tongue of that gay damsel in mine ear<br />
Yet rings. I like her wit well, she doth sport<br />
These humours nobly. Words from her charmed lips<br />
Do gather sweetness, and the sharpest taunt<br />
Falls from her harmless, veil'd in the soft tones<br />
Of her most delicate voice. And yet her presence<br />
I would not seek; a lurking mystery<br />
Hangs, or my thought deceives me, fathomless,<br />
Inscrutable, and dazzling as the veil<br />
That quells th' intruder's gaze. I watch'd her eye<br />
In secret yesternight, amid the feast;<br />
The soul that sate there laugh'd not, but her face<br />
With radiant smiles was sprinkled, dimpling o'er<br />
Like the soft waves on summer seas, with such<br />
Smooth, gentle undulation. Yet her eye<br />
Ne'er rose nor fell, but fix'd as some stern rock<br />

We cannot part. Blameless,&mdash;inanimate,&mdash;<br />
The heart alone makes thee its passive tool<br />
To work the several ills its thought conceives!<br />
What art thou, senseless steel? cold, motionless,<br />
Incapable of ought, or fraud or injury,&mdash;<br />
No dire intent there broods, no passionate flame<br />
Mix'd with thy temper, flashes o'er the obscure,<br />
The restless gulf within, troubling the spirit;<br />
A fitful gleam, on the dark surges wreathing<br />
Forms of unutterable horror,&mdash;wide<br />
Disclosing from the womb&mdash;the fathomless womb<br />

Why should I start?&mdash;a sound&mdash;a bursting bubble<br />
Moves me. Hermione!&mdash;Again!&mdash;This heart<br />
Not so hath leapt in the loud roar of battle!<br />
'Tis folly&mdash;madness,&mdash;yet she marks me out&mdash;<br />
Gazes so strangely,&mdash;'twere an idle thought,<br />
But from her soul, methinks, such pulses come<br />
Of wild, unworded passion, as they'd mingle,<br />
Perforce, with every faculty, desire,<br />
And through each avenue rush, thralling the will<br />
Unto its influence. Those basilisk eyes<br />
Are on me ever! Asleep, awake, they change not.<br />
'Tis fascination! If such spell there be,<br />
Hermione doth use it! Yet enchains she not<br />
Others unto the like. I've watch'd her thus,<br />
How angrily,&mdash;as the quick lightning sped,<br />
The night uncovering from her form,&mdash;I saw<br />
Her eagle-glance the timorous love-sick wretch<br />
Strike helpless at her feet. It is not love,&mdash;<br />

Poisoning life's current even at its source.<br />

When passion's rudest burst hath pass'd, and reason,<br />
As yon pale gleam, thus struggling forth its way<br />
Through adverse clouds, visits again the soul&mdash;<br />
'Tis then the mind, shuddering, at once recoils<br />
From the dire consequence, and conjures up<br />
A thousand possibilities to scare<br />
The resolute purpose. I linger at the threshold<br />
Of this proceeding. I will not fight thee, stranger;<br />

We love these moon-lit walks, Hermione,<br />
Whilst in her wane: you like her visage best,<br />
Perchance, increasing. More I love to mark<br />
Her gradual decay&mdash;retreating coy,<br />
And half aside, as if ashamed to meet<br />
The full gaze of the sun.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">hermione.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">I love the waxing</span><br />
Yet rather than the wane of yon pale light:<br />
Like timid maid, when first her opening charms<br />
Meet love's warm beam. Scarce on the wanton boy<br />
She dares to gaze, till, bolder grown, her eye<br />
Averted still, or half withdrawn, drinks in,<br />
With silent ecstacy, love's treacherous glance.<br />
Now his fond smile, full orb'd, the embolden'd sight<br />
Enamour'd meets: her very being, essence,<br />
And every faculty absorb&mdash;each thought<br />
Rising impregn'd with love's fierce fire; anon<br />
There comes a change&mdash;shy gleams succeed, her brow<br />
Hath one slight shade, scarce seen, but on its light<br />
The darkness grows&mdash;love's brightest dream is o'er,<br />
And his pale taper quench'd in utter gloom!</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">ridolfi.</span></span><br />
Ay, till another change. Yon fickle goddess<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>Her fond, fool'd swain entices, till enamour'd<br />
E'en to his heart's last core; she then averts<br />
Her love-impassion'd glance, and, scorning, shuns him!</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 9em;"><span class="smcap">duchess.</span></span><br />
If from deserted maid, Hermione,<br />
Whose charms were withering in the fallow wane<br />
Of an unprofited life, this speech forlorn<br />
Had seem'd to ring the knell of her young hopes.<br />
But when from rosy lips, and ardent youth,<br />
It comes unlook'd for as a wintry chill<br />
Beneath a summer sun.&mdash;This air blows keenly,<br />
My locks fall with the dew&mdash;I think the night<br />
Hath not its wonted soothness: thrice I shudder'd<br />
As the cold breeze methought sigh'd on my bosom.<br />
I must begone&mdash;Hermione, you go not.<br />
'Tis the last moonlight you behold, mayhap,<br />
In this brief stay; take a long parting, ere<br />
Ye bid adieu&mdash;the Duke himself attends you;<br />

<h2>MOTHER RED CAP;</h2>

<h5>OR,</h5>

<h3>THE ROSICRUCIANS.</h3>

<h3>A LEGEND OF THE NORTH.</h3>


<h4><br />PART THE FIRST.</h4>

<p>In the wild and mountainous region of East Lancashire, at
the foot of the long line of hills called Blackstonedge, and
not far from the town of Rochdale, stood one of those old
grim-looking mansions, the abode of our Saxon ancestors;
a quiet sheltered nest, where ages and generations had alike
passed by. The wave of time had produced no change;
the name and the inheritance were the same, and seemingly
destined to continue unaltered by the mutations, the common
lot of all that man labours to perpetuate. This state
of things existed at the date of our story; now, alas! the
race of its former possessors is extinct, their name only remains
a relic of things that were,&mdash;their former mansion
standing<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>, as if in mockery, amidst the hum of wheels,
and in melancholy contrast with the toil and animation
of this manufacturing, money-getting district.</p>

<p>Buckley Hall, to which we allude, is still an object of
interest to the antiquary and the lover of romance, telling
of days that are for ever departed, when the lords of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
paternal acres were the occupants, not impoverishers, of the
soil from unrecorded ages,&mdash;constituting a tribe, a race of
sturdy yeomanry attached to their country and to the lands
on which they dwelt. But they are nigh extinct,&mdash;other
habits and other pursuits have prevailed. Profuse hospitality
and rude benevolence have given place to habits of
business as they are called, and to a more calculating and
enterprising disposition. The most ancient families have
become absorbed or overwhelmed by the mighty progress of
this new element, this outpouring of wealth as from some
unseen source; and in many instances their names only are
recognised in these old and rickety mansions, now the habitation
of the mechanic and the plebeian.</p>

<p>Many of these dwellings remain,&mdash;a melancholy contrast
to the trim erections, the symbols of a new race, along
with new habits and forms of existence, sufficiently testifying
to the folly and the vain expectations of those who
toil and labour hard for a long lease with posterity.</p>

<p>This mansion, like the rest of our ancestral dwellings of
the better sort, was built of wood, on a stone basement.
The outside structure curiously vandyked in a zig-zag
fashion with wooden partitions, the interstices were filled
with wicker-work, plastered with well-tempered clay, to
which chopped straw imparted additional tenacity. When
newly embellished, looking like the pattern, black and white,
of some discreet magpie perched on the wooden pinnacles
terminating each gable, or hopping saucily about the porch,&mdash;that
never-failing adjunct to these homely dwellings.
Here, on a well-scoured bench, the master of the house
would sit in converse with his family or his guests, enjoying
the fresh and cheering breeze, without being fully exposed
to its effects. The porch was universally adopted as a protection
to the large flagged hall called the "house-part,"
which otherwise might have been seriously incommoded by
the inclement atmosphere of these bleak districts. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
side of the hall, containing the great fire-place, was the
"guest parlour." Here the best bed was usually fixed;
and here, too, all great "occasions" took place. Births,
christenings, burials, all emanated from, or were accomplished
in, this family chamber. Every member was there
transmitted from the cradle to the grave. The low wide
oaken stairs, to the first bending of which an active individual
might have leaped without any such superfluous
media. The naked gallery, with its little quaint doors on
each side, hatched in the usual fashion, this opening into
the store-room, that into the servants' lodging, another into
the closet where the choicest confections were kept. Opposite
were the bedchambers, and at the extremity of the
gallery a ladder generally pointed the way to a loft, where,
amongst heaps of winter stores, dried roots, and other vegetables,
probably reposed one or two of the male servants
on a straw mattrass, well fortified from cold by an enormous
quilt.</p>

<p>Our description will apply with little variation to all.&mdash;We
love these deserted mansion-houses, that speak of the
olden time, its good cheer and its rude but pleasant intercourse;
times and seasons that are for ever gone,&mdash;though
we crave pardon for indulging in what may perhaps find
little favour in the eyes of this generation, whose hopes and
desires are to the future, who say the past is but the childhood
of our existence,&mdash;it is gone, and shall not return.
But there are yet some who love to linger on the remnants,
the ruins of a former state, who look at these time-honoured
relics but as links that bring them into closer communion
with bygone ages, and would fain live in the twilight of
other years rather than the meridian splendour of the present.
But we must not be seduced any further by these
reflections; our present business concerns the legend whose
strange title stands at the head of this article.</p>

<p>In one of the upper chambers at Buckley Hall before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
named, and not long ago, was an iron ring fixed to a
strong staple in the wall; and to this ring a fearful story
is still attached. The legend, as it is often told, is one of
those wild improbable fictions based on facts, distorted and
embellished to suit the taste of the listener or the fancy of
the narrator. It will be our task to make out from these
imaginative materials a narrative divested, as much as
possible, of the marvellous, but, at the same time, retaining
so much as will interest and excite the reader and lover of
legendary lore.</p>

<p>It was in one of those genial, mellow, autumnal evenings,&mdash;so
dear to all who can feel their influence, and so rare
a luxury to the inhabitants of this weeping climate,&mdash;when
all living things wear the hue and warmth of the glowing
atmosphere in which they are enveloped, that two lovers
were sauntering by the rivulet, a "wimpling burn" that,
rising among the bare and barren moorlands of this uncultivated
region, runs past Buckley Hall into the valley of
the Roch.</p>

<p>It was near the close of the sixteenth century, in the
days of good Queen Bess, yet their apparel was somewhat
homely even for this era of stuffed doublets and trunk-hose.
Such unseemly fashions had hardly travelled into these
secluded districts; and the plain, stout, woollen jacket of
their forefathers, and the ruffs, tippets, stays, and stomachers
of their grandmothers, formed the ordinary wear of
the belles and beaux of the province. Fardingales, or
hooped petticoats, we are happy to say, for the sake of our
heroine, were unknown.</p>

<p>"Be of good cheer," said the lover; "there be troubles
enow, believe me, without building them up out of our own
silly fears&mdash;like boys with their snow hobgoblins, terrible
enough in the twilight of fancy, but a gleam of sunshine
will melt and dissipate them. Thou art sad to-night
without reason. Imaginary fears are the worst to cope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
withal; having nor shape nor substance, we cannot combat
with them. 'Tis hard, indeed, fighting with shadows."</p>

<p>"I cannot smile to-night, Gervase; there's a mountain
here&mdash;a foreboding of some deadly sort. I might as soon
lift 'Robin Hood's Bed,' yonder, as remove it."</p>

<p>"No more of this, my dearest Grace; at least, not now.
Let us enjoy this bright and sunny landscape. How
sharply cut are those crags, yonder, on the sky. Blackstonedge
looks almost within a stride, or at least a good stone's
throw. Thou knowest the old legend of Robin Hood;
how that he made yonder rocks his dormitory, and by
way of amusement pitched or coited huge stones at a mark
on the hill just above us, being some four or five miles
from his station. It is still visible along with several
stones lying near, and which are evidently from the same
rock as that on which it is said he slept."</p>

<p>"I've heard such silly tales often. Nurse had many of
these old stories wherewith to beguile us o' winter nights.
She used to tell, too, about Eleanor Byron, who loved a
fay or elf, and went to meet him at the fairies' chapel
away yonder where the Spodden gushes through its rocky
cleft,&mdash;'tis a fearful story&mdash;and how she was delivered
from the spell. I sometimes think on't till my very flesh
creeps, and I could almost fancy that such an invisible
thing is about me."</p>

<p>With such converse did they beguile their evening walk,
ever and anon making the subject bend to the burden of
their own sweet ditty of mutual <i>unchanging</i> love!</p>

<p>Grace Ashton was the only daughter of a wealthy
yeoman, one of the gentry of that district, residing at Clegg
Hall, a mile or two distant. Its dark, low gables and
quiet smoke might easily be distinguished from where they
stood. It was said that the Cleggs, its original owners,
had been beggared and dispossessed by vexatious and
fraudulent lawsuits; and the Ashtons had achieved their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
purpose by dishonesty and chicane. However this might
be, busy rumour gave currency and credit to the tale,
though, probably, it had none other foundation than the idle
and malevolent gossip of the envious and the unthinking.</p>

<p>They had toiled up a narrow pathway on the right of
a woody ravine, where the stream had evidently formed
itself a passage through the loose strata in its course. The
brook was heard, though hidden by the tangled underwood,
and they stopped to listen. Soothing but melancholy was
the sound. Even the birds seemed to chirp there in a sad
and pensive twitter, not unnoticed by the lovers, though
each kept the gloomy and fanciful apprehensions untold.</p>

<p>Soon they gained the summit of a round heathery knoll,
whence an extensive prospect rewarded their ascent. The
squat, square tower of Rochdale Church might be seen
above the dark trees nestling under its grey walls. The
town was almost hidden by a glowing canopy of smoke
gleaming in the bright sunset,&mdash;towards the north the
bare bleak hills, undulating in sterile loneliness, and associating
only with images of barrenness and desolation.
Easterly, a long, level burst of light swept across meadow,
wood, and pasture; green slopes dotted with bright homesteads,
to the very base apparently of, though at some
distance from, Blackstonedge, now of the deepest, the most
intense blue. Such a daring contrast of colour gave a
force and depth to the landscape, which, had it been
portrayed, would to critical eyes, perhaps, have outraged
the modesty of Nature.</p>

<p>The sky was already growing cold and grey above the
ridge opposed to the burning brightness of the western
horizon, and Grace Ashton pointed out the beautiful but
fleeting hues of the landscape around them. Her companion,
however, was engrossed by another object. Before
them was an eminence marking the horizon to the north-west,
though not more than a good bow-shot from where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
they stood. Between this and their present standing was
a little grassy hollow, through which the brook we have
described trickled rather than ran, amidst moss and rushes,
rendering the ground swampy and unsafe. On this hill
stood "Robin Hood's coit-stones;" and on the largest,
called the "marking-stone," a wild-looking and haggard
figure was couched. Her garments, worn and tattered,
were of a dingy red; and her cap, or <i>coiffure</i> as it was
then called, was of the same colour. Her head was bent
forward beyond the knee, as though she were listening
towards the ground, or was expecting the approach of the
individuals who now came suddenly, and to themselves
unexpectedly, in view. Her figure, in the glow of that
rich autumnal sky, looked of the deepest crimson, and of
a bloody and portentous aspect.</p>

<p>"What strange apparition is yonder," said Gervase
Buckley, "on the hill top there before us? Beshrew me,
Grace, but it hath an evil and a rancorous look."</p>

<p>But Grace, along with a short scream of surprise, betrayed,
too, her recognition of the object, and clung with
such evident terror to her companion that he turned from
the object of his inquiries to gaze on his mistress.</p>

<p>"What!" said he, "hath yonder unknown such power?
Methinks it hath moved thee strangely. Speak, Grace; can
that hideous appearance in any way be linked with our
destiny?"</p>

<p>"I am ignorant as thou. But its coming, as I have
heard, always forbodes disaster to our house. Hast not
heard of a Red Woman that sometimes haunts this neighbourhood?
I never saw her until now, but I've heard
strange and fearful stories of her appearing some years ago,
and blighting the corn, poisoning the cattle, with many
other diabolical witcheries. She is best known by the
name of 'Mother Red Cap.'"</p>

<p>"I've heard of this same witch in my boyhood. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
what should we fear? She is flesh and blood like ourselves;
and, in spite of the prevailing belief, I could never
suppose power would be granted to some, generally the
most wicked and the most worthless, which from the rest of
mankind is capriciously withholden."</p>

<p>"Hush, Gervase; thou knowest not how far the arch-enemy
of mankind may be permitted to afflict bodily our
guilty race. I could tell thee such tales of yonder creature
as would stagger even the most stubborn of unbelievers."</p>

<p>"I will speak to her, nevertheless. Tarry here, I prithee,
Grace. It were best I should go alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not&mdash;do not! None have sight of her, as I've
heard, but mischief follows. What disaster then may we
not expect from her evil tongue. I shudder at the anticipation.
Stay here. I will not be left; and I cannot cross
this dangerous swamp."</p>

<p>Buckley was, however, bent on the adventure. His natural
curiosity, inflamed by forbidden longing after the occult
and the mysterious to which he was too prone, even though
sceptical as to their existence, rendered him proof against
his mistress' entreaties.</p>

<p>Probably from situation, or rather, it might be, the distance
was judged greater than in reality it proved, but the
form before them looked preternaturally enlarged, and, as
she raised her head, her arms were flung out high above
it like withered and wasted branches on each side.
Trembling in every limb, Grace clung to her lover, and it
was after long persuasion that she suffered him to lift her
over the morass, and was dragged unwillingly up the hill.
As though she were the victim of some terrible fascination,
her eyes were constantly riveted on the object. A raven
wheeled round them, every moment narrowing the circle of
its flight, and the malicious bird looked eager for mischief.</p>

<p>As they approached nearer to the summit this ill-omened
thing, after having brushed so close that they felt the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
breath from its wings, alighted beside the Red Woman,
who hardly seemed to notice, though well aware of their
proximity.</p>

<p>They paused when several paces distant, and she rose up
suddenly, extending both arms, apparently to warn them
from a nearer approach. Her skinny lips rapidly moving
to and fro, and her dark, withered, bony, and cadaverous
features, gave her more the appearance of a living mummy,
or a resurrection from the charnel-house, than aught instinct
with the common attributes of humanity.</p>

<p>Buckley was for a moment daunted. The form was so
unlike anything he had ever seen. He was almost persuaded
of the possibility that it might be some animated
corpse doomed to wander forth either for punishment or
expiation. Her lips still moved. A wild glassy eye was
fixed upon them, and as she yet stood with extended arms,
Gervase, almost wrought to desperation, cried out,</p>

<p>"Who art thou? Thy business here?"</p>

<p>A hollow sound, hardly like the tones of a human voice,
answered in a slow and solemn adjuration:</p>

<p>"Beware, rash fools! None approach the Red Woman
but to their undoing."</p>

<p>"I know no hindrance to my free course in this domain.
By whose authority am I forbidden?" said he, taking
courage.</p>

<p>"Away&mdash;mine errand is not to thee unless provoked."</p>

<p>"Unto whom is thy message?"</p>

<p>"To thy leman&mdash;thy ladye-love, whom thou wilt cherish
to thine hurt. Leave her, ay, though both hearts break in
the separation."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>"Then be partaker of the wrath that is just ready to
burst upon her doomed house."</p>

<p>"I told thee," said Grace, "she is the herald of misfortune!
What woe does she denounce? What cruel judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
hast thou invoked upon our race?" cried she to this
grim messenger of evil.</p>

<p>"Evil will&mdash;Evil must! I will cling to ye till your last
sustenance be dried up, and your inheritance be taken from
ye."</p>

<p>"Her fate be mine," said Buckley, indignantly. "Her
good or evil fortune I will share."</p>

<p>"Be it so. Thou hast made thy choice, and henceforth
thou canst not complain."</p>

<p>She stretched out her two hands, one towards Clegg Hall,
the abode of the maiden, and the other towards Buckley,
her lover's paternal roof, from which a blue curl of smoke
was just visible over the rising grounds beneath them.</p>

<p>"A doom and a curse to each," she muttered. "Your
names shall depart, and your lands to the alien and the
stranger. Your honours shall be trodden in the dust, and
your hearths laid waste, and your habitations forsaken."</p>

<p>In this fearful strain she continued until Buckley cried
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cease thy mumbling, witch. I'll have thee dealt with
in such wise thy tongue shall find another use."</p>

<p>Turning upon him a look of scorn, she seemed to grow
fiercer in her maledictions.</p>

<p>"Proud minion," she cried, "thou shalt die childless and
a beggar!"</p>

<p>The cunning raven flapped his great heavy wings and
seemed to croak an assent. He then hopped on his mistress'
shoulder, and apparently whispered in her ear.</p>

<p>"Sayest thou so?" said the witch. "Then give it to
me, Ralph."</p>

<p>The bird held out his beak, and out popped a plain gold
ring.</p>

<p>"Give this to thy mother, Dame Buckley. Say 'tis long
since they parted company; and ask if she knows or remembers
aught of the Red Woman. Away!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>She threw the ring towards them. Both stooped to pick
it up. They examined it curiously for a short space.</p>

<p>"'Tis a wedding-ring," said Buckley, "but not to wed
bride of mine. Where was this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short in his inquiry, for lifting up his eyes
he found the donor was gone!</p>

<p>Neither of them saw the least trace of her departure.
The stone whereon she sat was again vacant. All was
silent, undisturbed, save the night breeze that came sighing
over the hill, moaning and whistling through the withered
bent and rushes at their feet.</p>

<p>The shadows of evening were now creeping softly around
them, and the valley below was already wrapped in mist.
The air felt very chill. They shuddered, but it was in
silence. This fearful vision, for such it now appeared to
have been, filled them with unspeakable dread.</p>

<p>Gervase yet held the ring in his hand. He would have
thrown it from him, but Grace Ashton forbade.</p>

<p>"Do her bidding in this matter," said she. "Give it thy
mother, and ask counsel of the sage and the discreet. There
is some fearful mystery,&mdash;some evil impending, or my apprehensions
are strangely misled."</p>

<p>They returned, but he was more disturbed than he cared
to acknowledge. He felt as though some spell had been
cast upon him, and cowed his hitherto undaunted spirit.</p>

<p>They again wound down beside the rivulet into the
meadows below, where the mist alone pointed out the
course of the stream. The bat and the beetle crossed their
path. Evil things only were abroad. All they saw and
felt seemed to be ominous of the future. As they passed
through a little wicket to the hall-porch, Nicholas Buckley
the father met them.</p>

<p>"Why how now, loiterers? The cushat and the curlew
have left the hill, and yet ye are abroad. 'Tis time the
maiden were at home, and looking after the household."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've been hindered, good Sir. We will just get speech
of our dame, and then away home with the gentle Grace.
Half an hour's good speeding will see her safe."</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;belike," said the old man. "Lovers and loiterers
make mickle haste to part. Our dame is with the maids
and the milk-pans i' the dairy."</p>

<p>The elder Buckley was a hale hearty yeoman, of a ruddy
and cheerful countenance. A few wrinkles were puckered
below the eyes; the rest of his face was sleek and comfortably
disposed. A beard, once thick and glossy, was grown
grey and thin, curling up, short and stunted, round his portly
chin. Two bright twinkling eyes gave note of a stirring
and restless temper&mdash;too sanguine, may be, for success in the
great and busy world, and not fitted either by education or
disposition for its suspicions or its frauds. Yet he had the
reputation of a clever merchant. Rochdale, even at that
early period, was a well-known mart for the buyers and
sellers of woollen stuffs and friezes. Many of the most
wealthy merchants, too, indulged in foreign speculations and
adventures, and amongst these the name of Nicholas Buckley
was not the least conspicuous.</p>

<p>They passed on to the dairy, where Dame Eleanor scolded
the maids and skimmed the cream at the same moment, by
way of economy in time.</p>

<p>"What look ye for here?" was her first inquiry, for truly
her temper was of a hasty and searching nature; somewhat
prone, as well, to cavilling and dispute; requiring much of
her husband's placidity to furnish oil for the turbulent waters
of her disposition.</p>

<p>"Thou wert better at thy father's desk, than idling after
thine unthrifty pleasures: to-morrow, may be, sauntering
among the hills with hound and horn, beating up with all
the rabble in the parish."</p>

<p>"Nay, mother, chide not: I was never made for merchandize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and barter&mdash;the price of fleeces in Tod-lane, and the
broad ells at Manchester market."</p>

<p>"And why not?" said the dame, sharply. "Haven't I been
the prop and stay of the house? Haven't I made bargains
and ventures when thou hast been idling in hall and bower
with love-ditties and ladies' purfles?"</p>

<p>She was now moved to sudden choler, and Gervase did
not dare to thwart her further,&mdash;letting the passion spend
itself by its own efforts, as he knew it were vain to check
its torrent.</p>

<p>Now Dame Eleanor Buckley was of a sharp and florid
countenance,&mdash;short-necked and broad-shouldered, her nose
and chin almost hiding a pair of thin severe lips, the two
prominences being close neighbours, especially in anger. In
truth she guided, or rather managed, the whole circle of
affairs; aiding and counselling the speculations of her husband,
who had happily been content with the produce and
profit of his paternal acres, had not his help-mate, who inherited
this mercantile spirit from her family, urged her
partner to such unwonted lust and craving for gain.</p>

<p>A huge bundle of keys hung at her girdle, which, when
more than usually excited, did make a most discordant jingle
to the tune that was a-going. Indeed, the height and violence
of her passion might be pretty well guessed at by this
index to its strength.</p>

<p>When the storm had in some degree subsided, Gervase
held up the ring.</p>

<p>"What's that, silly one? A wedding-ring!"</p>

<p>She grew almost pale with wrath. "How darest thou?&mdash;thee!&mdash;a
ring!&mdash;to wed ere thou hast a home for thy pretty
one. Ye may go beg, for here ye shall not tarry. Go to
the next buckle-beggar! A pretty wedding truly! When thou
hast learned how to keep her honestly, 'twill be time enough
to wed. But thou hast not earned a doit to put beside her
dower, and all our ready monies, and more, be in trade;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
though, for the matter o'that, the pulling would be no great
business either. But I tell thee again, thy father shall not
portion an idler like thyself and pinch his trade. Marry,
'tis enough to do, what with grievous sums lost in shipwrecks,
and the time we have now to wait our returns from
o'er sea."</p>

<p>She went on at this rate for a considerable space, pausing
at last, more for lack of breath than subject-matter of discourse.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, when fairly run down; "'tis not a
purchase, 'tis a gift."</p>

<p>"By some one sillier than thyself, I warrant."</p>

<p>"I know not for that&mdash;I had it from a stranger."</p>

<p>"Stranger still," she replied sharply, chuckling at her own
conceit.</p>

<p>"Look at it, mother,&mdash;Know you such an one?"</p>

<p>The dame eyed it with no favour, but she turned it over
with a curious look, at the same time lifting her eyes now
and then towards the ceiling, as though some train of recollection
was awakening in her mind.</p>

<p>"Where gat ye this?" said Dame Eleanor, in a subdued
but still querulous tone.</p>

<p>"On the hill-top yonder."</p>

<p>"Treasure-trove belongs to Sir John Byron.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> The Lord
of the Manor claims all from the finders."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>
<p>"It was a gift."</p>

<p>"Humph. Hast met gold-finders on the hills, or demons
or genii, that guard hidden treasure?"</p>

<p>"We've seen the Red Woman!"</p>

<p>Had a sudden thunder-clap burst over them, she could not
have been more startled. She stood speechless, and seemingly
incapable of reply. Holding the ring in one hand, her
eyes were intently fixed upon it.</p>

<p>"What is it that troubles you?" said Gervase. "Yon
strange woman bade me give you the ring, and ask if so be
that you remembered her."</p>

<p>The dame looked up, her quick and saucy petulance exchanged
for a subdued and melancholy air.</p>

<p>"Remember thee! thou foul witch,&mdash;ay, long, long
years have passed: I thought thy persecutions at an end;
thy prediction was nigh forgotten. It was my wedding-ring,
Gervase!"</p>

<p>"More marvellous still."</p>

<p>"Peace, and I'll tell thee. Grace Ashton, come forward.
I know thine ears are itching for the news. Well, well, it
was when thou wast but a boy, Gervase, and I remember an
evening just like this. I was standing by the draw-well
yonder, looking, I now bethink me, at the dove-cote where
I suspected thieves; and in a humour somewhat of the
sharpest, I trow. By-and-bye comes what I thought an impudent
beggar-woman for an alms. Her dress was red and
tattered, with a high red cap to match. I chided her, it
might be somewhat harshly, and I shall not soon forget the
malicious look she put on. 'I ask not, I need not thy
benison,' she said; 'I would have befriended thee, but I now
curse thee altogether:' and stretching out her shrivelled
arm, dry and bare, she shook it, threatening me with vengeance.
Suddenly, or ere I was aware, she seized my left
hand, drew off my wedding-ring; breathing upon it and
mumbling a spell, she held it as though for me to take back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
but with such a fiendish look of delight that I hesitated. All
on the sudden I remembered to have heard my grandmother
say, that should a witch or warlock get your wedding-ring,
and have time to mutter over it a certain charm, <i>so long as
that ring is above ground</i>, so long misery and misfortune do
afflict the owner. Lucky it was I knew of this, for instead
of replacing it I threw it into the well, being the nearest
hiding-place. And happy for me and thee it was so near;
for, would you believe, though hardly a minute's space in my
hand, the black heifer died, the red cow cast her calf, and a
large venture of merchandize was wrecked in a fearful gale
off the gulph. I had no sooner thrown it into the well than
the witch looked more diabolical than ever. 'It will come
again, dame,' said she, 'and then look to it;' and with this
threat she departed. But what am I doing? If it be the
ring, which I doubt not, I've had it o'er long in my keeping.
Even now disaster may be a-brewing; and is there
not a richly freighted ship on its passage with silks and
spices? I'll put it out of her reach this time anyhow. No!
I'll hide it where never a witch in Christendom shall poke
it out."</p>

<p>Dame Eleanor went to the little burn below. Stooping, she
scooped a hole in the gravel under water; there she laid the
ring, and covered it over with stones.</p>

<p>"Thou'rt always after some of thy megrims, dame," said
the elder Buckley, who had been watching her from the porch.
"Some spell or counter-charm, I'se warrant."</p>

<p>With a look of great contempt for the incredulity of her
spouse, she replied,</p>

<p>"Ay, goodman, sit there and scoff your fill. If't hadn't
been for my care and endeavours you had been penniless ere
now. But so it is, I may slave night and day, I reckon.
The whole roof-tree, as a body may say, is on my shoulders,
and what thanks? More hisses than thanks, more knocks
than fair words."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Never so well pleased as when opportunity was afforded
for grumbling, the dame addressed herself again to her evening
avocations.</p>

<p>Pondering deeply what should be the issue of these things,
Gervase set out with Grace Ashton to her house at Clegg
Hall, a good mile distant. Evening had closed in&mdash;a chill
wind blew from the hills. The west had lost its splendour,
but a pure transparent brightness filled its place, across
which the dark wavy outline of the high moorlands rested in
deep unvarying shadow. In these bright depths a still
brighter star hung, pure and of a diamond-like lustre, the
precursor, the herald of a blazing host just rising into
view.</p>

<p>As they walked on, it may well be supposed that the
strange occurrences of the last few hours were the engrossing
theme of their discourse.</p>

<p>"My mother is a little too superstitious, I am aware," said
Gervase. "But what I have witnessed to-night has rendered
me something more credulous on this head than aforetime."</p>

<p>"I don't half like this neighbourhood," said his companion,
looking round. "It hath an ill name, and I could almost
fancy the Red Woman again, just yonder in our path."</p>

<p>She looked wistfully; it was only the mist creeping lazily
on with the stream.</p>

<p>They were now ascending the hill towards Beil or Belfield,
where the Knights Templars had formerly an establishment.
Not a vestige now remains, though at that period a ruinous
tower covered with ivy, a gateway, and an arch, existed as
relics of their former grandeur.</p>

<p>"Here lived the Lady Eleanor Byron," said Grace, pointing
to the old hall close by, and as though an unpleasant
recollection had crossed her. She shuddered as they passed
by the grim archway beneath the tower. Whether it was
fancy or reality, she knew not, but as she looked curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
through its ivied tracery, she thought the Red Woman was
peering out maliciously upon them. She shrank aside, and
pointed to the spot; but there was nothing visible save the
dark and crumbling ruins, from which their steps were
echoed with a dull and sullen sound.</p>

<p>The night wind sighed round the grey battlements, and
from its hidden recesses came moans and whispers, at least
so it seemed to their heated imaginations.</p>

<p>"Let us hasten hence," said Grace; "I like not this lonely
spot. There was always a fear and a mystery about it. The
tale of the invisible sylphid and Eleanor Byron's elfish lover,
haunts me whenever I pass by, and I feel as though something
was near, observing and influencing every movement
and every thought."</p>

<p>"Come, come, adone I pray. Let not fear o'ermaster reason,
else we shall see bogles in every bush."</p>

<p>Above the gateway, in the little square tower now pulled
down, was a loop-hole, nearly concealed by climbing shrubs,
which rendered it easy for a person within to look out without
being observed. As they passed, a low humming din
was heard. Then a rude ditty trolled from some not unskilful
performer. The lovers stayed to listen, when a dark
figure issued out of the gateway singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The bat haunts the tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red-breast the bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the merry little sparrow by the chimney hops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good e'en, hoots master owl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-whoo, to-whoo, his troll,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sing heigho, swing the can with&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"What, thee, Tim! is that thy stupid face?" said Gervase,
breaking in upon his ditty, and right glad to be delivered
from supernatural fears, though the object of them proved
only this strolling minstrel. "Thou might as well kill us
outright as frighten us to death."</p>

<p>He that stood before them was one of those wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
musicians that haunt fairs and merry-makings, wakes, and
such like pastimes; playing the fiddle and jewtrump too at
weddings and alehouses; in short, any sort of idleness never
came amiss to these representatives of the old Troubadours.
A tight oval cap covered his shaggy poll; he was clad in a
coarse doublet or jerkin slashed in the fashion of the time,
while his nether integuments were fastened in the primitive
mode by a wooden skewer. He could conjure too, and play
antics to set the folks agape; but as to his honesty, it was
of that dubious sort that few cared to have it in trust. He
was apt at these alehouse ditties,&mdash;many of them his own
invention. He knew all the choicest ballads too, so that his
vocation was much akin to the <i>jogleurs</i> or <i>jongleurs</i> of more
ancient times, when Richard of the Lion's Heart and other
renowned monarchs disdained not "<i>the gentle craft of poesie</i>."</p>

<p>Wherever was a feast, let it be a wedding or a funeral,
Tim, like the harpies of old, scented the meat, and some of
his many vocations were generally in request.</p>

<p>This important functionary now stood whistling and singing
by turns with the most admired unconcern.</p>

<p>"What's thy business here?" cried Gervase, approaching
him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The maid was fair and the maid was coy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lover left, and the maid said 'Why?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sing Oh, the green willow!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Answerest thou me with thy trumpery ditties? I'll
have thee put i' the stocks, sirrah."</p>

<p>"Oh ha' mercy, master! there's naught amiss 'at I know.
I'm but takin' roost here wi' the owls an' jackdaws a bit,
may be for want o' better lyin'."</p>

<p>"It were hard to have a better knack at lying, than thou
hast already. Hast gotten the weather into thy lodgings?
When didst flit to thy new quarters?"</p>

<p>"Th' hay-mow at Clegg is ower savoured wi' the new
crop, an' I want fresh air for my studies."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now art thou lying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a lover to his sweetheart," said Tim, interrupting
him, and finishing the sentence.</p>

<p>"Peace, knave! There's some mischief i' the wind. Thou'rt
after no good, I trow."</p>

<p>"What te dickons do I ail here? Is't aught 'at a man
can lift off but stone wa's an' ivy-boughs? Marry, my little
poke maun ha' summut else to thrive on nor these."</p>

<p>"There's been great outcry about poultry an' other farmyard
appendances amissing of late, besides eggs and such
like dainties enow to furnish pancakes and fritters for the
whole parish. Hast gotten company in thy den above there?"</p>

<p>"Jacks an' ouzles if ye like, Master Gervase. Clim' up,
clim' up, lad, an' there'll be a prial on us. Ha, ha! What!
our little sweetheart there would liefer t' be gangin'. Weel,
weel, 'tis natural, as a body may say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One is good, and two is good,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But three's no company."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Answer me quick, thou rogue. Is there any other but
thyself yonder above?"</p>

<p>"When I'm there I'm not here, an' when I'm here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sirrah, I'll flog the wind out o' thy worthless carcase.
Hast any pilfering companions about thee? I do smell a
savoury refection,&mdash;victuals are cooking, or my nose belies
its office."</p>

<p>"Fair speech, friend, wins a quiet answer; a soft word
and a smooth tongue all the world over. What for mayn't
I sup as well as my betters?"</p>

<p>"As well? better belike. There's no such savour in our
hall at eventide, nor in the best kitchen in the parish."</p>

<p>"It's not my fau't, is't?"</p>

<p>"By'r lady, there's somebody in the chamber there. I saw
the leaves fluttering from the loophole. Villain, who bears
thee company?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Daft, daft. What fool would turn in to roost wi' me?
Clean gone crazy, sure as I'm livin'."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, there's some plot here,&mdash;some mischief hatching.
I'll see, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was just going to make the attempt; but Tim withstood
him, and in a peremptory manner barred the way.</p>

<p>"How! am I barred by thee, and to my face?"</p>

<p>"It's no business o' thine, Master Gervase. What's
hatching there, concerns not thee. Keep back, I say, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! Thou jingle-pated rascal, stand off, or I'll wring
thy neck round as I would a jackdaw."</p>

<p>"Do not, do not, Gervase!" said Grace Ashton, fearful of
some unlucky strife. "Let us begone. We are too late
already, and 'tis no business of ours."</p>

<p>"What! and be o'erfoughten by this scurvy lack-wit.
Once more, who is there above?"</p>

<p>"An' what if I shouldn't tell thee?"</p>

<p>"I'll baste thy carcase to a mummy; I'll make thee tender
for the hounds."</p>

<p>"Another word to that, master, an' it's a bargain."</p>

<p>"Let me pass."</p>

<p>"Not without my company."</p>

<p>"He whistled, and in a moment Gervase felt himself
pinioned from behind. Looking round, he saw two stout
fellows with their faces covered; and any other possibility
of recognition was impracticable in the heavy twilight.</p>

<p>"Who's i' t' stocks now?" cried the malicious rogue,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Unhand me, or ye'll rue that ever ye wrought this outrage."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, that were a pretty stave, when we've gotten
the bird, to open the trap," said Tim.</p>

<p>Gervase immediately saw that another party had seized
Grace Ashton. He raved and stamped until his maledictions
were put an end to by an effectual gag, and he did not doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
but she had suffered the same treatment, for a short sharp
scream only was heard. Being immediately blindfolded, he
could only surmise that her usage was of a similar nature.</p>

<p>He was so stupified with surprise, that for a short period
he was hardly sensible to their further proceedings. When
able to reflect, he found himself pinioned, and in a sitting
posture. A damp chill was on his forehead. He had been
dragged downwards, and, from the motion, steps were the
medium of descent. A door or two had been raised or
opened, a narrow passage previously traversed, and a short
time only elapsed from the cool freshness of the evening air
to the damp and stifling atmosphere that he now breathed.
What could be cause of his seizure, he was quite incompetent
to guess. He could not recollect that he had either
pique or grudge on his hands; and what should be the result,
he only bewildered and wearied himself by striving to
anticipate.</p>

<p>It was surely a dream. He heard a voice of ravishing
sweetness; such pure and silvery tones, that aught earthly
could have produced it was out of the question; it was like
the swell of some Eolian lyre,&mdash;words too, modifying and
enhancing that liquid harmony. It was a hymn, but in a
foreign tongue. He soon recognised the evening hymn to
the Virgin:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mater amata, intemerata,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ora, ora, pro nobis."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So sweetly did the music melt into his soul, that he quite
forgot his thrall, and every sense was attuned to the melody.
When the sound ceased, he made an effort to get free. He
loosened his hands, and immediately tore off the bandage
from his eyes. A few seconds elapsed, when he saw a
light streaming through a crevice. Looking through, he
saw a taper burning before a little shrine, where two females
in white raiment, closely veiled, were kneeling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The celebration of such rites, at that time strictly prohibited,
sufficiently accounted for their concealment, and
plainly intimated that the parties were not of the Reformed
faith.</p>

<p>By the light which penetrated his cell from this source,
he saw it was furnished with a stone bench, and a narrow
flight of steps in one corner communicated with a trap-door
above.</p>

<p>The old mansion at Belfield, contiguous to these ruins,
once belonging to the Knights of St. John, had been for
some years untenanted, and, as often happens to the lot of
deserted houses, strange noises, sights, and other manifestations
of ghostly occupants were heard and seen by passers-by,
rendering it a neighbourhood not overliked by those
who had business that way after nightfall.</p>

<p>Gervase Buckley was pretty well assured that he had
been conveyed into some concealed subterranean chamber,
but for what purpose he could not comprehend. He was
not easily intimidated; and, though in a somewhat sorry
plight, he now felt little apprehension on the score of supernatural
visitations: but his seizure did not hold out an immunity
as regards corporeal disturbers. He had not long
to indulge these premonitory reflections ere a door was
opened. A figure, completely enveloped in a black cloak,
on which a red cross was conspicuously emblazoned, stood
before him. He carried a torch, and Gervase saw a short
naked sword glittering in his belt.</p>

<p>"Follow me," said the intruder; and, without further
parley, pointed to where another door was concealed in the
pavement. This being opened, Gervase beheld, not without
serious apprehension, a flight of steps evidently communicating
with a lower dungeon. His conductor pointed to the
descent, and it would have been useless folly to disobey. A
damp and almost suffocating odour prevailed, as though from
some long pent up atmosphere, which did not give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
prisoner any increasing relish or affection for the enterprise.
He looked at his conductor, whose face and person were yet
covered. Had he been a familiar of the Holy Inquisition,
he could not have been more careful of concealment. Gervase
looked now and then with a wistful glance towards his
companion's weapon. Being himself unarmed, it would
have been madness to attempt escape. He merely inquired
in his descent,</p>

<p>"Whence this outrage? I am unarmed, defenceless."
But there was no reply. The guide, with an inclination of
the head, pointed with his torch to the gulph his victim was
about to enter. There was little use in disputation where the
opposite party had so decided an advantage, and he thought
it best to abide the issue without further impediment. He
accordingly descended a few steps. His conductor fastened
the door overhead, and they soon arrived at the bottom, at
a low arched passage, where his guide dashed his flambeau
against the wall, and it was immediately extinguished.</p>

<p>Gervase was left once more in doubt and darkness. There
was little space for explanation. He felt himself seized by
an invisible hand, hurried unresistingly on, till, without any
preparation, a blaze of light burst upon him.</p>

<p>It was for a moment too overpowering to enable him to
distinguish objects with any certainty. Soon, however, he
saw a tolerably spacious vault, or crypt, supported by massy
pillars. He had often heard there existed many unexplored
subterranean passages reaching to an incredible distance,
made originally by the Knights Templars for their private
use. One of these, it was said, extended even to the chantry
just then dissolved at Milnrow, more than a mile distant.
Many strange stories he had been told of these warrior
monks. But centuries had elapsed since their suppression.
For a moment, he almost believed they were permitted to
re-appear, doomed at stated periods to re-enact their unhallowed
orgies, their cruelties and their crimes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
chamber was lighted by three or four torches, their lurid
unsteady light giving an ever-varying character to the surrounding
objects.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance was a stone bench, occupied by
several figures attired in a similar manner to his conductor.
An individual in the centre wore in addition a belt, covered
by some cabalistic devices. The scene was sufficiently
inexplicable, and not at all elucidated by the following interrogation:</p>

<p>"Thou hast been cited to our tribunal," said the chief inquisitor.</p>

<p>"I know ye not," said Gervase with great firmness, though
hardly aware of the position he occupied.</p>

<p>"Why hast thou not obeyed our summons?"</p>

<p>"I have not heard of any such; nor in good sooth should
I have been careful to obey had your mandate been delivered."</p>

<p>"Croix Rouge," said the interrogator; "has this delinquent
been cited?"</p>

<p>The person he addressed arose, bowed, and presented a
written answer.</p>

<p>"I have here," continued the chief, "sufficient proof that
our summons hath been conveyed to thee, and that hitherto
thine answer hath been contumaciously withheld. What
sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"I have yet to learn, firstly," said Gervase, with more
indignation than prudence, "by what authority ye would
compel me to appear; and, secondly, how and in what form
such mandate hath been sent?"</p>

<p>"Bethink thee, is our answer to the last,&mdash;the first will be
manifested in due time. We might indeed leave thee
ignorant as to what we require, but pity for thy youth and
inexperience forbids. Clegg Hall is, thou knowest, along
with the estate, now unlawfully holden by the Ashtons."</p>

<p>"I know that sundry Popish recusants plotting the overthrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
of our most gracious Queen, do say that other and
more legitimate rights are in abeyance only; but the present
owners are too well fortified to be dispossessed by
hearsay."</p>

<p>"In the porch at Clegg thou wast accosted not long ago
by a mendicant who solicited an alms."</p>

<p>"Probably so."</p>

<p>"Did he not hold out to thee the sign of the Rosy Cross,
the token of our all-powerful fraternity of Rosicrucians?"</p>

<p>"I do remember such a signal; and furthermore, I drove
him forth as an impostor and a pretender to forbidden
arts."</p>

<p>"He showed thee the sign, and bade thee follow."</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"And why was our summons disobeyed?"</p>

<p>"Because I have yet to learn what authority you possess
either for my summons or detention."</p>

<p>"The brotherhood of the Red Cross are not disobeyed
with impunity."</p>

<p>"I have heard of such a fraternity,&mdash;as well too that they
be idle cheats and lying impostors."</p>

<p>"We challenge not belief without sufficient testimony to
the truth of our mission. In pity to man's infirmity this indulgence
is permitted. We unfold the hidden operations,
the very arcana of Nature, whom we unclothe as it were to
her very nakedness. Our doctrines thereby carry credence
even to the most impious and unbelieving. Ere we command
thy submission, it is permitted to behold some manifestation
of our power. By means derived from the hidden essences
of Nature, the first principles which renovate and govern all
things, the very elements of which they consist, we arrive at
the incorporeal essence called spirit, holding converse with
it undebased, uninfluenced by the intervention of matter.
Thus we converse in spirit with those that be absent, even
though they were a thousand leagues apart."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what has this jargon to do with my being dispatched
hither?"</p>

<p>"Listen, and reply not; the purport will be vouchsafed to
thee anon. We can compel the spirits even of the absent to
come at our bidding by subtle spells that none have power
to disobey. We too can renew and invigorate life, and by
the universal solvent bring about the renovation of all
things,&mdash;renovation and decay being the two antagonist
principles, as light and darkness. As we can make darkness
light, and light darkness at our pleasure, so can we from
decay bring forth life, and the contrary. Seest thou this
dead body?"</p>

<p>A black curtain he had not hitherto observed, was thrown
aside, and he beheld the features of Grace Ashton, or he was
strangely deceived. She was lying on a little couch, death
visibly imprinted on her collapsed and sunken features.</p>

<p>"Murderers! I will have ye dealt with for this outrage."
Maddened almost to frenzy he would have rushed towards
her, but he was firmly holden by a power superior to his
own.</p>

<p>"She is now in the first region of departed spirits," said
the chief. "We have power to compel answer to our interrogatories.
Listen, perverse mortal. We are well assured
that a vast treasure is concealed hereabouts, hidden by the
Knights of St. John. 'Tis beyond our unassisted power to
discover. We have asked counsel of one whom we dare not
disobey, and she it is hath commanded that we cite thee and
Grace Ashton to the tribunal of the Rosy Cross. This corporeal
substance now before us, by reason of its intimate
union with the spirit, purged from the dross of mortality,
will answer any question that may be propounded, and will
utter many strange and infallible prophecies. It will solve
doubtful questions, and discourse of things past, present, and
to come, seeing that she is now in spirit where all knowledge
is perfect, and hath her eyes and understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
cleared from the gross film of our corruption. But as spirit
only hath power over those of its own nature, by the law of
universal sympathy, so she answers but to those by whom
she is bidden, that are of the same temperament and affinity,
which is shown by your affiance and love toward each
other."</p>

<p>The prisoner heard this mystic harangue with a vacant
and fixed expression, as though his mind were wandering,
and he hardly understood the profundity of the discourse.
Every feeling was absorbed in the conviction that some
horrid incantation had for ever deprived him of his beloved.
Then he fancied some imposition had been practised upon
him. Being prevented from a closer examination, at length
he felt some relief in the idea that the form he beheld might
possibly be a counterfeit. He knew not what to say, and
the speaker apparently waited his reply. Finding he was
still silent, the former continued after a brief space:</p>

<p>"Our questions to this purport must necessarily be propounded
by thee. Art thou prepared?"</p>

<p>"Say on," said Gervase, determined to try the issue, however
repugnant to his thoughts.</p>

<p>Two of them now arose and stood at each end of the
couch. The superior first made the sign of the Cross. He
then drew a book from his girdle, and read therein a Latin
exorcism against the intrusion of evil spirits into the body,
commanding those only of a heavenly and benign influence
to attend. He lighted a taper compounded of many strange
ingredients emitting a fragrant odour, and, as the smoke
curled heavily about him, flickering and indistinct, he looked
like some necromancer about to perform his diabolical rites.</p>

<p>The occupant of that miserable couch lay still as death.</p>

<p>"The first question," cried out the chief; and he looked
towards the prisoner, who was now suffered to approach
within a few paces of the bed.</p>

<p>"Is there treasure in this place?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Gervase tried to repeat the question, but his tongue clave
to his mouth. For the first time probably in his life he felt
the sensation of horrible, undefined, uncontrollable fear,&mdash;that
fear of the unknown and supernatural, that shrinking
from spiritual intercourse even with those we have
loved best. It seemed as though he were in communion
with the invisible world,&mdash;that awful, incomprehensible
state of existence; and with beings whose power and essence
are yet unknown, armed, in imagination, with attributes
of terror and of vengeance.</p>

<p>With a desperate effort, however, he repeated the question.
Breathless, and with intense agony, he awaited the
response. It came! A voice, not from the lips of the recumbent
victim, but as though it were some inward afflatus,
hollow and sepulchral. The lips did not move, but the
following reply was given.</p>

<p>"There is!"</p>

<p>Even the guilty confederates started back in alarm at the
success of their own experiment. All was, however, still,&mdash;silent
as before.</p>

<p>Taking courage, the next question was put in like
manner.</p>

<p>"In what direction?"</p>

<p>"Under the main pillar at the south-eastern corner of the
vault."</p>

<p>After another pause, the following questions were asked:</p>

<p>"How may we obtain the treasure sought?"</p>

<p>"By diligence and perseverance."</p>

<p>"At what time?"</p>

<p>"When the moon hath trine to Mercury in the house of
Saturn."</p>

<p>"Is it guarded?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"By a power that shall crush you unless propitiated."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Show us in what manner."</p>

<p>"I may not; my lips are sealed. That power is superior
to mine; the rest is hidden from me."</p>

<p>The treasure-seekers were silent, as though disappointed
at this unexpected reply. Another attempt was, however,
made.</p>

<p>"Shall we prosper in our undertaking?"</p>

<p>"My time is nigh spent. I beseech you that I may depart,
for I am in great torment."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not, until thou answer."</p>

<p>"Beware!"</p>

<p>But this admonition was from another source, and in a
different direction. The obscurity and smoke from the
torches made it impossible to judge with any certainty
whence the interruption proceeded.</p>

<p>Gervase started and turned round. It might be fancy,
but he was confident the features of the Red Woman were
present to his apprehension. Horrors were accumulating.
Even the united brotherhood seemed to tremble as though
in the presence of some being of whom they stood in awe.
They awaited her approach in silence.</p>

<p>"Fool! did I not warn thee to do <i>my</i> bidding only? And
thou art hankering again, pampering thy cruel lust for
gold. How darest thou question the maiden for this intent?
Hence, and thank thy stars thou art not even now
sent howling to thy doom!"</p>

<p>This terrible and mysterious woman came forward in
great anger, and the Rosicrucian brotherhood were thereby
in great alarm. "The maid is mine&mdash;begone!" said she,
pointing the way.</p>

<p>Like slaves under their master's frown, they crouched
before this fearful personification of their unhallowed and
forbidden practices, and departed.</p>

<p>"Gervase Buckley," she cried, "thou art betrothed to
the heiress of yon wide possessions."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am," said he, roused either to courage or desperation,
even in the presence of a being whose power he felt conscious
was not derived from one common source with his
own.</p>

<p>"Dost thou confirm thy troth?"</p>

<p>"I do; in life and in death she is mine."</p>

<p>"Pledge thyself, body and soul, to her."</p>

<p>"I am hers whilst I live, body and soul. Nothing but
death shall part us."</p>

<p>"On thy soul's hope thou wilt fulfil this pledge!"</p>

<p>"I will." Gervase looked wistfully towards his beloved.
The inanimate form was yet pale and still; but a vague
hope possessed him that the witch would again quicken her.</p>

<p>"'Tis enough. But it must be sealed with blood!"</p>

<p>He felt her clammy hand on his arm, and a sharp pain as
though from a puncture. He quickly withdrew it, and a
blood-drop fell on the floor.</p>

<p>"Thou art mine&mdash;for ever!"</p>

<p>A loud yell rang through the vaults, and Gervase felt as
though the doom of the lost spirits were his,&mdash;that a whole
troop of fiery demons had assailed him, and that he was
borne away to the pit of torment. Happily his recollection
forsook him, and he became unconscious of future suffering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<h4>PART THE SECOND.</h4>

<p>Morning rose bright and ruddy above the hills. The
elder Buckley was up and stirring betimes. Agreeably to
his usual practice, he had retired early to bed, leaving the
household cares and duties to his helpmate. He was sitting
in the porch, when his dame, with a disturbed and portentous
aspect, accosted him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know not what hath come to the lad."</p>

<p>"Gervase&mdash;what of him?" said Nicholas, carelessly.</p>

<p>"He came home very late yesternight. But he did not
speak, and he looked so wan and woe-begone, that I verily
thought he had seen a ghost or some uncanny thing yonder
on his road home. I've just now been to rouse him, but he
will not answer. Prithee go and get speech of him, good or
bad. I think i' my heart the lad's bewitched."</p>

<p>Nicholas Buckley was a man of few words, especially in
the presence of his helpmate, so he merely groaned out an
incredulous wonder, and went off as he was bidden. He
saw Gervase evidently under the influence of some stupifying
spell. His eyes were open, but he noticed neither the
question nor the person who accosted him. There was
something so horrible and mysterious in his whole appearance,
that the good man felt alarmed, and went back to his
dame with all possible expedition. What <i>could</i> have happened?
They guessed, and made a thousand odd surmises,
improbable enough the greater part, but all merging in the
prevailing bugbear of the day&mdash;witchcraft, which was
resorted to as a satisfactory explanation under every possible
difficulty. Had his malady any connection with the unexpected
appearance of the Red Woman and the ring? It was
safe buried, however, and that was a comfort. But after all,
her thoughts always involuntarily recurred to this unpleasant
subject. She could not shake off her suspicions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
there was little use in attempting further measures unless
she could fight the Evil One with his own weapons. To
this end, she began to cast about for some cunning wizard,
who might countervail the plots of this malicious witch.</p>

<p>Now at this period, Dr. Dee, celebrated for his extraordinary
revelations respecting the world of spirits, had been
promoted by Queen Elizabeth (a firm believer in astrology
and other recondite pursuits) to the wardenship of the
Collegiate Church at Manchester. His fame had spread far
and wide. He had not long been returned from his mission
to the Emperor Rodolph at Prague, and his intercourse with
invisible things was as firmly believed as the common occurrences
of the day, and as well authenticated.</p>

<p>The character of Dee has both been underrated and misunderstood.
By most, if not all, he has been looked upon
merely as a visionary and an enthusiast,&mdash;credulous and
ambitious, without the power, though he had sufficient will,
to compass the most mischievous designs. But under these
outward weaknesses and superstitions, tinctured and modified
by the prevailing belief in supernatural interferences,
there was a bold and vigorous mind, frustrated, it is true,
by circumstances which he could not control. Dee aimed at
the entire change and subjugation of affairs, ecclesiastical
and political, to the dominion of an unseen power,&mdash;a theocracy
or millenium,&mdash;himself the sole medium of communication,
the high priest and lawgiver. To this end he sought
the alliance and support of foreign potentates; and his diary
published by Casaubon, the original of which is in the
British Museum, is a remarkable and curious detail of the
intrigues resorted to for this purpose. His mission to the
Emperor Rodolph, offering him the sceptre of universal
dominion, is told with great minuteness; and there is little
doubt that Elizabeth herself did not disdain to converse and
consult with him on this extraordinary project. Her visits
to his house at Mortlake are well known. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
consulted as to a favourable day for her coronation, and
received many splendid promises of preferment, that were
never realised. At length, disappointed and hopeless as to
the success of his once daring expectations, he settled down
to the only piece of preferment within his reach, to wit, the
wardenship of the Collegiate Church at Manchester, where
he arrived with his family in the beginning of February,
1596. His advice and assistance were much resorted to,
and particularly in cases of supposed witchcraft and demoniacal
possession,&mdash;articles of unshaken belief at that period
with all but speculatists and optimists, the Sadducees of
their day and generation. His chief colleague throughout
his former revelations had been one Edward Kelly, born at
Worcester, where he practised as an apothecary. In his
diary, Dee says, they were brought together by the ministration
of the angel Uriel. He was called Kelly the Seer.
This faculty of "<i>seeing</i>" by means of a magic crystal not
being possessed by the Doctor, he was obliged to have recourse
to Kelly, who had or pretended to have this rare
faculty. Afterwards, however, he found out that Kelly had
deceived him; those spirits which ministered at his bidding
not being messengers from the Deity as he once supposed,
but lying spirits sent to deceive and to betray.</p>

<p>Kelly was an undoubted impostor, though evidently himself
a believer in magic and the black art. Addicted to
diabolical and mischievous practices, he was a fearful ensample
of those deluders given up to their own inventions to
believe the very lies wherewith they attempted to deceive.</p>

<p>He was a great treasure-hunter and invoker of demons,
and, it is said, would not scruple to have recourse to the
most disgusting brutalities for the gratification of his avarice
and debauchery. In Weaver's Funereal Monuments, it is
recorded that Kelly, in company with one Paul Waring,
went to the churchyard of Walton-le-Dale, near Preston,
where a person was interred at that time supposed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
hidden a large sum of money, and who had died without
disclosing the secret. They entered precisely at midnight,
the grave having been pointed out to them the preceding
day. They dug down to the coffin, opened it, and exorcised
the spirit of the deceased, until the body rose from the grave
and stood upright before them. Having satisfied their inquiries,
it is said that many strange predictions were uttered
concerning divers persons in the neighbourhood, which were
literally and remarkably fulfilled.</p>

<p>At the date of our legend, Kelly had been parted from the
Doctor for a considerable time. The Doctor having found
out his proneness to these evil courses, Kelly bore no good
will to his former patron and associate.</p>

<p>We have not space, or it would be an interesting inquiry,
as connected with the superstitions of our ancestors, to trace
the character and career of these individuals&mdash;men once
famous amongst their cotemporaries, forming part of the
history of those times, and exerting a permanent influence,
immediately on the national character, and remotely on that
of a future and indefinite period.</p>

<p>Dame Eleanor Buckley was morally certain, firstly, that
her son was witched; and, secondly, that no time should be
lost in procuring relief. Nicholas therefore took horse for
Manchester that very forenoon, with the intention of consulting
the learned Doctor above named, on his son's malady.
Ere he left, however, there came tidings that Grace Ashton
had not returned home, and was supposed to have tarried at
Buckley for the night.</p>

<p>Trembling at this unexpected news, the dame once more
applied to her son. He was still wide awake on the couch,
in the same position, and apparently unconscious of her presence.
In great anxiety she conjured him to say if he knew
what had befallen Grace Ashton.</p>

<p>"She is dead!" was his reply, in a voice strangely altered
from his usual careless and happy tone. Nothing further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
however, could be drawn from him, but shortly after there
came one with additional tidings.</p>

<p>"Inquiry has been set on foot," said the messenger,
"and Tim, well known at wakes and merry-makings, doth
come forward with evidence which justifies a suspicion that
is abroad, to wit, that she has met death by some unfair
dealing; and, further, he scruples not to throw out dark and
mysterious hints that implicate your son as being privy to
her disappearance."</p>

<p>At this unlooked for intelligence, the mother's fortitude
gave way. Tribulation and anguish had indeed set in upon
them like a flood. The ring, so unaccountably brought back
by the Red Woman, was beyond doubt the cause of all their
misfortunes&mdash;its reappearance, as she anticipated, being
the harbinger of misery. What should be the next arrow
from her quiver she trembled to forebode. But, in the
midst of this fever of doubt and apprehension, one hope
sustained her, and that was, the result of her husband's
mission to Doctor Dee, who would doubtless find out the
nature of the spell, and relieve them from its curse.</p>

<p>Let us follow the traveller to Dee's lodgings in the
deanery, where at that time this renowned astrologer was
located. Nicholas Buckley found him sitting in a small
dismal looking study, where he was introduced with little
show either of formality or hesitation. The Doctor was now
old, and his sharp, keen, grey eyes had suffered greatly by
reason of rheum and much study. Pale, but of a pleasant
countenance, his manner, if not so grave and sedate as became
one of his deep and learned research, yet displaying a
vigour and vivacity, the sure intimation of that quenchless
ardour, the usual concomitant of all who are destined to
eminence, or to any conspicuous part in the age on which
they are thrown,&mdash;not idle worthless weeds on the strand of
time, but landmarks or beacons in the ocean of life, to warn
or to direct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>He was short in stature, and somewhat thin. A rusty
black velvet cap, without ornament, surmounted his forehead,
from which a few straggling grey hairs crept forth,
rivalling his pale, thoughtful brow in whiteness.</p>

<p>He sat in a curiously embossed chair, with a brown-black
leathern cushion, beside an oaken table or tressel, groaning
under the weight of many ponderous volumes of all hues
and subjects. Divers and occult were the tractates there
displayed, and unintelligible save to the initiated. Alchemy
was just then his favourite research, and he was vainly endeavouring
to master the jargon under which its worthlessness
and folly were concealed.</p>

<p>Nicholas Buckley related his mishap, and, as far as he
was able, the circumstances connected with it. The Doctor
then erected a horoscope for the hour. After consulting this
he said:</p>

<p>"I will undertake for thee, if so be that my poor abilities,
hitherto sorely neglected, and I may say despised, can bring
thee any succour. Indeed the land groans by reason of the
sin of witchcraft,&mdash;a noisome plague now infesting this
afflicted realm, and a grievous scandal to the members and
ministers of our Reformed Church. The ring is of a surety
bewitched, and by one more powerful and wicked than thou
canst possibly imagine. I tell thee plainly, that unless the
charm be broken, the recovery of the young man were
vain,&mdash;nay, in all likelihood, thine own ruin will be the
result."</p>

<p>The merchant groaned audibly at this doleful news. He
thought upon his merchandise and his adventures o'er sea&mdash;his
treasures and his argosies, committed to the tender mercies
of the deep; and he recounted them in brief.</p>

<p>"Cannot these be rescued from such disaster?" inquired
he, dolefully.</p>

<p>"I know not yet," was the reply. "Saturn, that hath his
location here, governing these expected treasures, now beholds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the seventh house of the figure I have just erected, with a
quartile aspect. They be evil tokens, but as regards this
same Mother Red Cap or the Red Woman, who hath doubtless
brought you into grievous trouble, I know her. Nay,
look not incredulous. How, it is not needful to inquire.
Suffice it that she hath great power, though from a different
source from mine. She is of the Rosicrucian order, one of
the sisters, of which there are five throughout Europe and
Asia. They have intercourse with spirits, communicating
too with each other, though at never so great a distance, by
means of this mystical agency. She hath been here, aye,
even in the very place where thou sittest."</p>

<p>The visitor started from his chair.</p>

<p>"And I am not ignorant of her devices. She is of a
Papistical breed; and the recusant priests, if I mistake not,
are at the working of some diabolical plot; it may be against
the life and government of our gracious Queen! They would
employ the devil himself, if need were, to compass their
intent. She hath travelled much, and doubtless hath learned
marvellous secrets from the Moors and Arabian doctors. It
is however little to the purpose at present, that we continue
this discourse. What more properly concerns thee is how
to get rid of this grievous visitation; which, unless removed,
will of a surety fall out to thine undoing. By prayer and
fasting much may be accomplished, together with the use of
all lawful means for thy release."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Buckley, "I fear me there is little hope of a
favourable issue, and I may not be delivered from this wicked
one!"</p>

<p>"Be of good heart&mdash;we will set to work presently, and, if
it be possible, counterplot this cunning witch. But to this
end it is needful that I visit the young man, peradventure
we may gather tidings of her. I know not any impediment
to my journey this very day. Aye! even so," said he,
poring over some unimaginable diagrams. "Good! there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
a marvellous proper aspect for our enterprise thirty minutes
after midnight. Thou hast doubtless taken horse with thy
servant hither. I will take his place and bear thee company."</p>

<p>The Doctor was soon equipped for travel, much to the
comfort of the afflicted applicant, who was like to have taken
his departure with a sorry heart, and in great disquietude.
On their arrival at Buckley, Dee would needs see the patient
instantly. No change had taken place since morning, and
he still refused any sustenance that might be offered. The
Doctor examined him narrowly, but refrained from pronouncing
on his case.</p>

<p>It was now evening. The sun shot a languid and fitful
ray athwart the vapours gathering to receive him, and its
light shone full on the couch of the invalid. The astrologer
was sitting apart, in profound meditation. Dame Eleanor
suddenly roused him.</p>

<p>"He has just asked for the Red Woman," said she, "and I
heard him bemoaning himself, saying that he is betrothed to
her, and that she will come ere long to claim his pledge.
Hark, he mutters again!"</p>

<p>Dee immediately went to the bedside.</p>

<p>"I did not kill her," said the victim, shuddering. He
dashed the cold sweat from his forehead with some violence.
He then started up. "Is she come?" said he in a low, hollow
voice, and he sat up in the attitude of intense expectation.
"Not yet, not yet," he uttered with great rapidity, and sank
down again as though exhausted.</p>

<p>A stormy and lowering sky now gathered above the sun's
track, and the chamber suddenly grew dark. The inmates
looked as though expecting some terrific, some visible
manifestation of their tormentor. Dee looked out through
the window. There was nothing worthy of remark, save an
angry heap of clouds, rolling and twisting together, the sure
forerunner of a tempest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"The whole country is astir," said Dame Eleanor. "They
are seeking for the body of Grace Ashton in pits and secret
places. Woe is me that I should live to see the day;&mdash;the
poor lad there is loaden with curses, and fearful threatenings
are uttered against us. We are verily in jeopardy of our
lives."</p>

<p>Hereat she fell a weeping, and truly it was piteous to
behold.</p>

<p>"We must first get an answer from him," said the Doctor,
"ere measures can be devised for his recovery."</p>

<p>"'Tis said there will be a warrant for his apprehension on
the morrow," said the elder Buckley.</p>

<p>"There is some terrible perplexing mystery, if not
knavery in this matter," said Dee; "and I have been
thinking, nay I more than suspect, that rascal Kelly hath a
hand in it. He is ever hankering after forbidden arts, and
many have fallen the innocent victims to his diabolical
intrigues. He hath become a great adept of late, too, as I
am told, in this Rosicrucian philosophy; and, if we have
here a clue to our labyrinth, depend on it we'll get to the end
speedily. To spite and frustrate that juggling cheat, I will
spare neither pains nor study; though, of a surety, we only
use lawful and appointed means. Prayers and exorcisms
must be resorted to, and help craved from a higher source
than theirs."</p>

<p>At length the forms and usages generally resorted to on
such occasions were entered upon. Loud and fervent were
the responses, continuing even to a late hour, but without
producing any change.</p>

<p>The wind, hitherto rushing only in short fierce gusts
through the valley, now gathered in loud heavy lunges
against the corner of the house, almost extinguishing the
solitary light on the table near to which Dee sat; the
casements rattled, and the whole fabric shook as they
passed by. At length there came a lull, fearful in its very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
silence, as though the elements were gathering strength
for one mighty onslaught. On it came like an overwhelming
surge, and for a moment threatened them with immediate
destruction. Dust, pebbles, and dead branches were
flung on the window as though bursting through, to
the great terror of the inmates. Again it drew back,
and there was stillness so immediate, it was even more
appalling than the loudest assaults of the tempest. The
household, too, were silent. Even Dee was evidently disturbed,
and as though in expectation of some extraordinary
occurrence.</p>

<p>A sharp quick tapping was heard at the casement.</p>

<p>"What is that?" was the general inquiry. Gervase
evidently heard it too, and was, apparently, listening.</p>

<p>Dee arose. He went slowly towards the window, as if
carefully scrutinising what might present itself. He put
his face nearly close to the glass, and manifestly beheld
some object which caused him to draw back. His forehead
became puckered by intense emotion, either from surprise
or alarm. He put one finger on his brow, as though taking
counsel from his own thoughts, deliberating for a moment
what course to pursue. At length, much to the astonishment
of his companions, he opened the latch of the casement,
when, with a dismal croak, a raven came hopping in. With
outstretched wings he jumped down on the floor, and would
have gone direct to the bed, but the Doctor caught him, and
by main force held him back.</p>

<p>Fluttering and screaming, the bird made every effort to
escape, but not before Dee was aware of a label tied round
his neck. This he quickly detached; after which the
winged messenger flew back through the open window,
either having finished his errand, or not liking his entertainment.
Dee opened the billet&mdash;a bit of parchment&mdash;and
out dropped the ring! In the envelope was a mystical
scroll, encompassed with magic emblems, wherein was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
written the following doggrel, either in blood or coloured
so as to represent it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Alarm was but too legible on the Doctor's brow. He was
evidently taken by surprise. He read it aloud, while fearful
groans responded from the victim.</p>

<p>"'Tis a case of grievous perplexity," said he, "and I am
sore distraught. If he have sworn his very soul to her, as
this rhyme doth seem to intimate, I am miserably afflicted
for his case. Doubtless 'tis some snare which hath unwillingly
been thrown about him. Nevertheless, I will diligently
and warily address myself to the task, and Heaven
grant us a safe deliverance. Yet I freely own there is both
danger and extremity in the attempt. She will doubtless
appear and claim the fulfilment of his pledge. But I must
cope with her alone; none else may witness the conflict.
It is not the first time that I have battled with the powers
of darkness."</p>

<p>"But what motive hath she for this persecution? it is not
surely out of sheer malice," said the dame, weeping.</p>

<p>"Belike not," replied Dee, thoughtfully. "It doth savour
of those incantations whereof I oft read in divers tractates,
whereby she expects to gain advantage or deliverance if
she sacrifice another victim to the demon whereunto she
hath sold herself. Indeed, we hear of some whose tenure
of life can only be renewed by the yearly substitution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
another; and it is to this possible danger that our feeble
efforts must be directed. But I trust in aid stronger than
the united hosts of the Prince of Darkness. This very night,
I doubt not, will come the final struggle."</p>

<p>The wind was now still, but ever and anon bursts of hail
hurtled on the window. Thunder growled in the distance,
waxing louder and louder, until its roar might have appalled
the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>With many anxious wishes and admonitions the distressed
parents left the Doctor to himself.</p>

<p>He took from his pocket an hour-glass, a bible, and a
Latin translation from the Arabic, being a treatise on
witches, genii, demons, and the like, together with their
symbols, method of invocation, and many other subjects
equally useful. Intent on his studies, he hardly looked
aside save for the purpose of turning the glass, when he
immediately became absorbed as before.</p>

<p>Now and then he cast a glance towards the bed. His
patient lay perfectly quiet, but the Doctor fancied he was
listening.</p>

<p>About midnight he heard a groan; he shut his book, and,
looking aside, beheld the terrible eye and aspect of the Red
Woman glaring fiercely upon him. She had, in all likelihood,
been concealed somewhere within hearing; for a
closet door, on one side of the chamber, stood open as
though she had just issued from it.</p>

<p>With great presence of mind he adjured her that she
should declare her errand.</p>

<p>"I am here on my master's business; mine errand concerns
not thee," was the reply. Her terrible eyes glanced,
as she spoke, towards the bed where the unfortunate Gervase
Buckley lay writhing as though in torment.</p>

<p>"By what compact or agreement is he thine, foul sorceress?
Knowest thou not that there are bounds beyond
which ye cannot prevail?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"He hath sworn&mdash;the compact is sealed with blood, and
must be fulfilled. I am here to claim mine own; and it is
at thy peril thou prevent me."</p>

<p>"I fear thee not, but am prepared to withstand <i>thee</i> and
all thy works."</p>

<p>"Beware! There's a black drop in thine own cup," said
she. "Thou thyself hast sought counsel by forbidden arts,
and I can crush thee in a moment."</p>

<p>Dee looked as though vanquished on the sudden. He
was not altogether clear from this charge, having, though
at Kelly's instigation, been led somewhat further than was
advisable into practices which in his heart he condemned.
He, however, now felt convinced that Kelly had some hand
in the business, knowing too that he would associate with
the most wicked and abandoned, if so be that he might
compass his greedy and unhallowed desire.</p>

<p>"Depart whilst thou may," she continued. "I warn
thee. Yonder inheritance is mine, though the silly damsel
they have lost be the reputed heir. Aforetime I have told
thee. Wronged of our rights, I have sold myself, aye body
and soul, for revenge! By unjust persecutions we have
been proscribed, those of the true faith have been forced to
fly, and even our lands and our patrimony given to yon
graceless heretics."</p>

<p>"But why persecute this unoffending house?&mdash;they have
not done <i>thee</i> wrong."</p>

<p>"It is commanded&mdash;the doom must be fulfilled. One
condition only was appointed. A hard task, to wit&mdash;but
what cannot power and ingenuity compass?&mdash;'When one
shall pledge himself thine and for ever, then the inheritance
thou seekest is thine also, which none shall take from thee.
But he too must be rendered up to me.' This was the
doom! 'Tis fulfilled. He hath pledged himself body and
soul, and that ring, if need be, is witness to his troth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Grace Ashton living or dead?" inquired Dee, with a
firm and penetrating glance.</p>

<p>"When he hath surrendered to his pledge it shall be told
thee."</p>

<p>"Wicked sorceress," said the Doctor, rising in great
anger, "he shall not be thy victim; thine arts shall be
countervailed. The powers of darkness are not, in the
end, permitted to prevail, though for a time their devices
seem to prosper. Listen, and answer me truly, or I will
compel thee in such wise that thou darest not disobey. Was
there none other condition to thy bond?"</p>

<p>The weird woman here broke forth into a laugh so wild
and scornful, that the arch-fiend himself could hardly have
surpassed it in malice.</p>

<p>"Fret not thyself," she said, "and I will tell thee.
Know then I am scathless from all harm until that feeble
ring shall be able to bind me; none other bonds may
prevail."</p>

<p>"This ring bind thee?"</p>

<p>"Even so&mdash;and as a blade of grass I could rend it!
Judge then of my safety. Fire, air, and water&mdash;all the
elements&mdash;cannot have the power to hurt me; I hold a
charmed life. The price is paid!"</p>

<p>Dee looked curiously round the little thin ring which he
held, and indeed it were hopeless to suppose so frail a fetter
could restrain her.</p>

<p>"Thou hast told me the truth?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;on my hope of prospering in this pursuit of
our patrimony."</p>

<p>"And what is thy purpose with the lad?"</p>

<p>"I have need of him. He is my hostage to him whom I
serve."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not take him by force?"</p>

<p>"I will not. He will follow whithersoever I lead. He
has neither will nor power to disobey."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grant a little space I prithee. 'Tis a doleful doom for
one so young."</p>

<p>"To-morrow my time hath expired. Either he or I must
be surrendered to&mdash;&mdash;" Here she pointed downwards.</p>

<p>"Agreed. To-morrow, at this hour. We will be prepared."</p>

<p>The witch unwillingly departed as she came. The closet
door was shut as with a violent gust of wind, after which
Dee sat pondering deeply on the matter, but unable to come
to any satisfactory conclusion. He never suspected for one
moment, what in this evil and matter-of-fact generation
would have occurred even to the most credulous, to wit,
that either insanity or fanaticism, aided by fortuitous events,
if we may so speak, was the cause of this delusion, at least to
the unhappy woman now the object of Dee's most abstruse
speculations. His thoughts, however, would often recur to
his quondam associate Kelly, and, if in the neighbourhood,
which he suspected, an interview with him might possibly
be of use, and afford some clue to guide their proceedings.</p>

<p>Committing himself to a short repose, he determined to
make diligent search for this mischievous individual,&mdash;having
comforted in some measure the unhappy couple below
stairs, who were in a state of great apprehension lest their
son had already fallen a victim, and were ready to give up
all for lost.</p>

<p>Early on the ensuing day, the Doctor bent his steps towards
Clegg Hall, whence the old family of that name had
been dispossessed, and from whom that mysterious individual,
the Red Woman, claimed descent.</p>

<p>The air was fresh and bracing after the night's tempest.
Traces of its fury, however, were plainly visible. Huge
trees had been swept down, as though some giant hand had
crushed them. Rising the hill towards Belfield, he stayed
a moment to look round him. There was something in the
loneliness and desertion of the spot that was congenial to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
his thoughts. The rooks cawed round their ancient inheritance,
but all was ruin and disorder. His curiosity was
excited; he had sufficient local knowledge to remember it
was once an establishment of the Knights of St. John some
centuries before, and he remembered too, that, according to
vulgar tradition, great riches were buried somewhere in the
vaults. A thought struck him that it was not an unlikely
spot for the operations of Master Kelly. Impressed with
this idea, a notion was soon engendered that his errand
need not carry him further. He drew near to the ivied
archway beneath the tower. The mavis whistled for its
mate, and the sparrow chirped amongst the foliage. All
else was silent and apparently deserted. He entered the
gateway. Inside, on the right hand, was a narrow flight of
steps, and, impelled by curiosity, he clambered, though with
some difficulty, into a dilapidated chamber above. Here
the loopholes were covered with ivy, but it was unroofed,
and the floor was strewn with rubbish, the accumulation of
ages. Through a narrow breach at one corner he saw
what had once been a concealed passage, evidently piercing
the immense thickness of the walls, and leading probably
to some secret chambers not ordinarily in use. He now
heard voices below, and taking advantage thereby, crept
into the passage, probably expecting to gather some news
by listening to the visitors if they approached. Two of
these ascended the broken steps, and every word was audible
from his place of concealment. He instantly recognised
the voice of Kelly. The other was a stranger.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah! old Mother Red Cap, I tell thee, says we can
never get the treasure. By this good spade, and a willing
arm to wit, the gold is mine, ere two hours older," said
Kelly.</p>

<p>"I am terribly afeard o' these same bogarts," replied his
companion. "T'owd an&mdash;'ll come sure enough among us,
sure as my name's Tim, some time or another."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never fear, nunkey; thee knows what a lump I've promised
thee; an' as for the old one, trust me for that, I can
lay him in the Red Sea at any time. Haven't I and that old
silly Doctor, who pretends forsooth to have conscience
qualms when there's aught to be gotten, though as fond o'
the stuff as any of us,&mdash;haven't we, I say, by conjurations
and fumigations, raised and laid a whole legion o' them?
Why, man, I'm as well acquainted with the kingdom of
Beelzebub, and his ministers to boot, as I am with my own."</p>

<p>"Don't make sich an ugly talk about 'em, prithee, good
sir. I thought I heard some'at there i' the passage, an' I
think i' my heart I dar na face 'em again for a' th' gowd i'
th' monks' cellar."</p>

<p>"Tush, fool! If we get hold on't now, it shall be ours,
and none o' the rest of our brethren o' the Red Cross need
share, thee knows. But thou be'st but newly dubbed, an'
hardly initiated yet in our sublime mysteries. Nevertheless,
I will be indifferent honest too, and for thy great services
to us and to our cause, I do promise thee a largess,
when it comes to our fingers,&mdash;that is to say, one-fifth to
thee, and one-fifth to me; the other three shares do go to
the general treasure-house of the community, of which I
take half."</p>

<p>"A goodly portion, marry&mdash;but I'd liefer t' not gang
ony further."</p>

<p>"Villain! thou art bent on treachery; if thou draw back,
I'll ha' thee hanged, or otherwise punished for what thou
hast done. Remember, knave, thou art in my power."</p>

<p>The guilty victim groaned piteously, but he was irretrievably
entangled. The toils had been spread by a master
hand. He saw the gulf to which he was hurried, but
could not extricate himself.</p>

<p>"Yonder women, plague take 'em," said Tim; "what's up
now? I know this owd witch who's sold hersel' to&mdash;to&mdash;black
face I'm afeard, is th' owner o' many a good rood o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
land hereabout, an' t'owd Ha' too, wi' its 'purtenances. But
she's brought fro' Spain or Italy, as I be tou'd, a main lot
o' these same priest gear; an' they're lurkin' hereabout
like, loike rabbits in a warren, till she can get rid o' these
Ashtons. Mony a year long past I've seen her prowling
about, but she never could get her ends greadly till now."</p>

<p>"By my help, she shall," said Kelly; "it's a bargain between
us. She's brought her grandchildren too, who left
England in their youth, being educated in a convent o'er
seas. They're just ready to drop into possession."</p>

<p>"But poor Grace Ashton, she's gi'en me mony a dish of
hot porritch an' bannocks. She shauna be hurt, if I can
help it."</p>

<p>"Fool!&mdash;the wench must be provided for. Look thee,&mdash;if
she get away, she'll spoil all. When dead, young Buckley
must be charged with the murder."</p>

<p>"Weel, weel; but I'll ha' nought more to do wi't. E'en
tak' your own fling,&mdash;I'll wash my hands on't a'together,
an' so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want help, thou chicken-faced varlet,&mdash;come, budge,&mdash;to
thy work; we may have helpers to the booty, if time
be lost."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us!" said Tim, in great dolour, "I wish I had
ne'er had aught to do wi' treasure-hunting an' sich like occupation.
If ever I get rid of this job, if I don't stick to
my old trade hang me up to dry."</p>

<p>"Hold thy peace, carrion! and remember, should a whisper
even escape thee, I will have thee hanged in good
earnest."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye; just like Satan 'ticing to iniquity, an' then,
biggest rogue al'ays turns retriever."</p>

<p>"None o' thy pretences; thou hast as liquorish a longing
after the gold as any miser in the parish, and when the broad
pieces and the silver nobles jingle in thy fob, thoul't forget
thy qualms, and thank me into the bargain. Now to work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Let me see, what did the sleeping beauty say? Humph,&mdash;'Under
the main pillar at the south-east corner.' Good.
Nay, man, don't light up yet. Let us get fairly under
ground first, for fear of accidents."</p>

<p>To the great alarm of Dr. Dee, who heard every word,
these two worthies came straight towards the opening. He
drew on one side at a venture. Luckily, it proved the right
one; they proceeded up the passage in the opposite direction.
He heard them groping at the further end. A trap-door
was evidently raised, and he was pretty well convinced
they had found the way to the vaults; probably it had been
blocked up for ages until recently, and, in all likelihood,
Tim had pointed it out, as well as the notion that treasure
was concealed somewhere in these labyrinths.</p>

<p>How to make this discovery in some way subservient to
his mission was the next consideration; and with a firm
conviction, generally the forerunner of success, he determined
to employ some bold stratagem for their detection.
They were now fairly in the trap, and he hoped to make
sure of the vermin. For this end he cautiously felt his
way to the opposite extremity of the passage, where he
found the floor emitted a hollow sound. This was assuredly
the entrance; but he tried in vain,&mdash;it resisted every effort.
Here, however, he determined to keep watch and seize
them if possible on their egress, trusting to his good fortune
or his courage for help in any emergency that might ensue.
At times he laid his ear to the ground, but nothing was
audible as to their operations below. This convinced him
they were at a considerable distance from the entry, but
he felt assured that ere long they must emerge from their
den, when, taken by surprise, he should have little difficulty
in securing the first that came forth, keeping fast the door
until he had made sure of his captive.</p>

<p>He watched patiently for some time, when all on a
sudden he heard a rumbling subterraneous noise, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
plainly felt the ground tremble under his feet. A loud
shriek was heard below, and presently footsteps approaching
the entrance. He had scarcely time to draw aside ere the
door was burst open, and some one rushed forth. The
Doctor seized him by the throat, and, ere he had recovered
from his consternation, dragged him out of the passage.</p>

<p>"Villain! what is it ye are plotting hereabout? Confess,
or I'll have thee dealt with after thy deserts."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;I'll&mdash;tell&mdash;all&mdash;I will&mdash;" sobbed out the delinquent,
gasping with terror. Tim, for it was none other,
fell on his knees, crying for mercy. "Whoever thou art,"
continued he, "come and help&mdash;help for one that's fa'n
under a heavy calamity. Bad though he be, we maunna
let him perish for lack o' lookin' after."</p>

<p>"Has't got a light, knave?"</p>

<p>"I'll run an' fetch one."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay; we part not company until better acquainted.
Is there not a candle below?"</p>

<p>"Alas! 'tis put out&mdash;and&mdash;oh! I'd forgotten; here's
t' match box i' my pocket."</p>

<p>He drew forth the requisite materials, and they were
soon equipped, exploring the concealed chambers we have
before described. With difficulty they now found their
way, by reason of the dust arising from the recent catastrophe.
Dee followed cautiously on, keeping a wary eye
on his leader lest some deceit or stratagem should be intended.</p>

<p>They now approached a heap of ruins almost choking the
entrance to the larger vault. He thought groans issued
from beneath.</p>

<p>"He's not dead yet," said Tim. "Here, here, good sir;
help me to shift this stone first."</p>

<p>They set to work in good earnest, and, with no little
difficulty and delay, at length succeeded in releasing the
unfortunate treasure-hunter. Eager to possess the supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
riches, they had incautiously undermined one of the main
supports of the roof, and Kelly was buried under the ruins.
Fortunately he lay in the hollow he had made, otherwise
nothing but a miracle could have saved him from immediate
death. He was terribly bruised, nevertheless, and
presented a pitiable spectacle. Bleeding and sore wounded,
he was hardly sensible as they bore him out into the fresh
air. Apparently unable to move, they laid him on the
ground until help could be obtained. In a while he recovered.</p>

<p>"Thou art verily incorrigible," said the Doctor to his
former associate. "Where is the maiden ye have so
cruelly conveyed away?"</p>

<p>But Kelly was dogged, and would not answer.</p>

<p>"I have heard and know all," continued Dee; "so that,
unless thou wilt confess, assuredly I will have thee lodged
in the next jail on accusation of the murder. Thy diabolical
practices will, sooner or later, bring thee to punishment."</p>

<p>"Promise not to molest me," said Kelly, who feared
nothing but the strong arm of the law, so utterly was he
given over to a reprobate mind, even to commit iniquity
with greediness.</p>

<p>"What! and let thee forth to compass other, and may
be more heinous, mischief? I promise nothing, save that
thou be prevented from such pursuits. Thou hast entered
into covenant with the woman whom it is our purpose, in
due time, to deliver up to the secular arm. Ye think to
compass your mutual ends by this compact; but be assured
your schemes shall be frustrated, and that speedily."</p>

<p>At this Kelly again fell into a sulky mood, maimed and
helpless though he was; and revenge, dark and deadly,
distorted his visage.</p>

<p>Tim here stepped forward.</p>

<p>"I do repent me of this iniquity, an' if ever I'm catched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
meddlin' wi' sich tickle gear again, I'll gie ye leave to hang
me up without judge or jury."</p>

<p>"The best proof of repentance is restitution," said the
Doctor. "Knowest thou aught of the maiden?"</p>

<p>"I'll find her, if ye can keep that noisome wizard frae
hurting me. He swears that if I tell, e'en by nods, winks,
or otherwise, he'll send me to &mdash;&mdash; in a whirlwind."</p>

<p>"I will give thee my pledge, not a hair of thy head
shall be damaged."</p>

<p>"He has the key in his pocket."</p>

<p>"What of that?"</p>

<p>"It's the key to the old house door yonder, an' she's
either there, or but lately fetched away."</p>

<p>The Doctor proceeded, though not without opposition, to
the search. The key was soon produced, and, accompanied
by the repentant ballad-monger, he approached the mansion,
which, as we have before noticed, was near at hand, apparently
untenanted.</p>

<p>"Yonder knave, I think, cannot escape," said Dee.</p>

<p>"No, no," said his conductor, "unless some'at fetches
him; he's too well hampered for that. His legs are aw
smashed wi' that downfa'."</p>

<p>They entered a little court almost choked up with leaves
and long grass. The door was unlocked, and a desolate
scene presented itself. The hall was covered with damp
and mildew, all was rotting in ruin and decay. Tim led
the way up stairs. The same appearances were still manifest.
The dark shadow of death seemed to brood there,&mdash;an
interminable silence. They entered a small closet, nearly
dark; and here, on a miserable pallet, lay the form of
Grace Ashton! now, alas! pale and haggard. She seemed
altogether unconscious of their presence. The horrid events
of the preceding night had brought on mental as well as
bodily disease. It was the practice of these treasure-seekers,
either to raise up a dead body for the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
information, or to throw the living into such a state of
mental hallucination that they should answer dark and
difficult questions whilst in that condition. It not unfrequently
happened, however, that the unfortunate victims
to these horrid rites either lost their lives or their reason
during the experiment.</p>

<p>We will not pursue the recital in the present case:
suffice it to say that Grace Ashton was immediately removed
and placed under the care of her friends; the
Doctor went back to Kelly for further disclosures, but what
was his surprise to find that, by some means or another,
he had escaped. He now lost no time in returning to
Buckley, communicating the painful, though in some degree
welcome, intelligence that Grace Ashton had been rescued
from her persecutors.</p>

<p>It was now time to adopt measures for their reception
of the witch, who would, doubtless, not fail in her appointment.</p>

<p>Dee was yet in doubt as to the issue, and he thought it
needful to acquaint them with the only method by which
the spell could be broken. How it were possible that the
ring should ever bind her was a mystery that at present he
could not solve. Dame Eleanor listened very attentively,
then sharply replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have heard o' this charm aforetime, or&mdash;&mdash;By'r
Lady, but I have it!"</p>

<p>She almost capered for joy.</p>

<p>We will not, however, anticipate the result, but intreat
our readers to suspend their guesses, and again accompany
us to the chamber where lay the heir of Buckley, still
grievously tormented.</p>

<p>Midnight again approached. Dee was sitting at the
table, apparently in deep study. He had examined the
closet, and found it communicated by another passage to
an outer door; and it was through this that the Red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Woman had contrived to enter without being observed.
The learned Doctor was evidently awaiting her approach
with no little anxiety. Once or twice he fancied some one
tapped at the casement,&mdash;but it was only the wind rushing
by in stormy gusts, increasing in strength and frequency as
the time drew nigh.</p>

<p>Hark! was not that a distant shriek? It might be the
creaking of the boughs and the old yew-tree by the door,
thought Dee; and again, in a while, he relapsed into a
profound reverie. Another! He heard the jarring of
rusty hinges; a heavy step; and&mdash;the Red Woman stood
beside him!&mdash;but with such a malevolent aspect that he
was somewhat startled and uneasy at her presence.</p>

<p>"I am beguiled of my prey!&mdash;mocked&mdash;thwarted. But
beware, old man; thy meddling may prove dangerous. I
will possess the inheritance, though every earthly power
withstood me! That boy is mine. He hath sworn it&mdash;sealed
it with his heart's blood&mdash;and I demand the pledge."
The victim groaned. "Hearest thou that response?&mdash;'Tis
an assent. He is mine in spite of your stratagems."</p>

<p>This was, probably, but the raving of a disordered
intellect, but Dee was too deeply imbued with the superstitions
of the age to suppose for a moment that it was not
a case of undisguised witchcraft, or that this wicked hag
was not invested with sufficient power to execute whatever
either anger or caprice might suggest.</p>

<p>"What is thy will with the wretched victim thou hast
ensnared?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I have told thee."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not convey him away bodily to his tormentors?"</p>

<p>"Unless they have a victim the inheritance may not be
mine." She said this with such a fiendish malice that
made even the exorcist tremble. His presence of mind,
however, did not forsake him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ring&mdash;I remember&mdash;there was a condition in the
bond. In all such compacts there is ever a loophole for
escape."</p>

<p>"None that thou canst creep through," she said, with a
look of scorn.</p>

<p>"It is not permitted that the children of men be tempted
above measure."</p>

<p>"When that ring shall have strength to bind me, and
not till then. All other bonds I rend asunder. Even
adamant were as flaming tow."</p>

<p>"Here is a ring of stout iron," said Dee, pointing to an
iron ring fixed by a stout staple in the wall. "I think it
would try thy boasted strength."</p>

<p>"I could break it as the feeble reed."</p>

<p>The Doctor shook his head incredulously.</p>

<p>"Try me. Thou shalt find it no empty boast."</p>

<p>She seemed proud that her words should be put to the
test; and even proposed that her arms should be pinioned,
and her body fastened with stout cords to the iron ring
which had been prepared for this purpose.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt soon find which is the strongest," said she,
exultingly. "I have broken bonds ere now to which these
are but as a thread."</p>

<p>She looked confident of success, and surveyed the whole
proceeding with a look of unutterable scorn.</p>

<p>"Now do thy worst, thou wicked one," said Dee, when
he had finished.</p>

<p>But lo! a shriek that might have wakened the dead.
She was unable to extricate herself, being held in spite of
the most desperate efforts to escape. With a loud yell she
cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast played me false, demon!"</p>

<p>"'Tis not thy demon," said Dee; "it is I that have circumvented
thee. In that iron ring is concealed the charmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
one, wrought out by a cunning smith to this intent,&mdash;to
wit, the deliverance of a persecuted house."</p>

<p>The Red Woman now appeared shorn of her strength.
Her charms and her delusions were dispelled. She sank
into the condition of a hopeless, wretched maniac, and was
for some time closely confined to this chamber.</p>

<p>Buckley, recovering soon after, was united to Grace
Ashton, who it is confidently asserted, and perhaps believed,
was restored to immediate health when the charm
was broken.</p>

<h2>THE DEATH-PAINTER;</h2>

<h5>OR,</h5>

<h3>THE SKELETON'S BRIDE.</h3>


<p>"This will hardly keep body and soul together," said
Conrad Bergmann, as he eyed with a dissatisfied countenance
some score of dingy kreutzers thrust into his palm by a
"patron of early genius,"&mdash;one of those individuals who
take great merit to themselves by just keeping their victims
in that enviable position between life and death;&mdash;between
absolute starvation and hopeless, abject poverty, which effectually
represses all efforts to excel, controls and quenches
all, but longings after immortality,&mdash;who just fan the flame,
to let it smoke and quiver in the socket, but sedulously
prevent it rising to any degree of steadiness and brilliance.</p>

<p>Conrad that morning had taken home a picture, his sole
occupation for two months, and this patron, a dealer in the
"fine arts," dwelling in the good, quiet city of Mannheim,
had given him a sum equivalent to thirty-six shillings sterling
for his labour. Peradventure, it was not in the highest
style of art; but what Schwartzen B&auml;ren or Weisse R&ouml;sse&mdash;Black
Bears, White Horses, Spread Eagles, and the like,
the meanest, worst painted signs in the city, would not have
commanded a higher price?</p>

<p>In fact, Conrad had just genius enough to make himself
miserable; to wit, by aspiring after those honours it was
impossible to attain, keeping him thereby in a constant fret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
and disappointment, instead of being content with his station,
or striving for objects within his reach. Could he
have drudged on as some dauber of sign-posts, or taken to
useful employment, he might, doubtless, have earned a comfortable
sustenance. He had, however, like many another
child of genius, a soul above such vulgarities; yearning
after the ideal and the vain; having too much genius for
himself and too little for the world: suspended in a sort of
Mahomet's coffin, between earth and heaven, contemned,
rejected, by "gods, men, and columns."</p>

<p>Conrad Bergmann was about two and twenty, of good
figure and well-proportioned features. Complexion fair,
bright bluish-grey eyes, whiskers well matched with a pale,
poetical, it might be sickly, hue of countenance, and an expression
more inclining to melancholy than persons of such
mean condition have a right to assume. His father had
brought him up to a trade, an honest, thriving business, to
wit, that of <i>Knopfmacher</i> (button-maker). But Conrad,
the youngest, and his mother's favourite, happened to be
indulged with more idle time than the rest, which, for the
most part, was laudably expended in scrawling sundry
hideous representations&mdash;all manner of things, on walls
and wainscoats. Persevering in this occupation, he was
forthwith pronounced a genius. About the age of fifteen,
Conrad saw a huge "St. Christopher," by a native artist,
and straightway his destiny was fixed. He struggled on
for some years with little success, save being pronounced
by the gossips "marvellously clever." His performances
wanted that careful and elaborate course of study indispensable
even to the most exalted genius. They were not only
glaring, tawdry, and ill-drawn, but worse conceived; flashy,
crude accumulations of colour, only rendering their defects
more apparent. He was, in a great measure, self-taught.
His impetuous, ardent imagination could not endure the
labour requisite to form an artist. He would fain have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
read ere he had learned to spell; and the result might
easily have been foretold.</p>

<p>His father died; and the family were but scantily provided
for. Conrad was now forced to make out a livelihood
by what was previously an amusement, not having "a
trade in his fingers;" and he toiled on, selling his productions
for the veriest trifle. He had now no leisure for
improvement in the first elements of his art.</p>

<p>"Better starve or beg, better be errand-boy or lackey,
than waste my talents on such an ungrateful world. I'll
turn conjurer&mdash;fire-eater&mdash;mountebank;&mdash;set the fools
agape at fairs and pastimes. Anything rather than killing&mdash;starving
by inches. Why, the criminals at hard labour
in the fortress have less work and better fare. I wish!&mdash;I
wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What dost wish, honest youth?" said a tall, heavy-eyed,
beetle-browed, swarthy personage, who poked his face round
from behind, close to that of the unfortunate artist, with
great freedom and familiarity.</p>

<p>"I wish thou hadst better manners, or wast i' the stocks,
where every prying, impertinent should be," replied Conrad,
being in no very placable humour with his morning's work.
The stranger laughed, not at all abashed by this ill-mannered,
testy rebuke, replying good-humouredly,</p>

<p>"Ah, ah! master canvass-spoiler. Wherefore so hasty
this morning? My legs befit not the gyves any more than
thine own. But many a man thrusts his favours where
they be more rare than welcome. I would do thee a service."</p>

<p>"'Tis the hangman's, then; for that seems the only favour
that befits my condition."</p>

<p>"Thou art cynical, bitter at thy disappointment. Let us
discourse together hard by. A flask of good Rhenish will
soften and assuage thy humours. A drop of <i>Kirchenwasser</i>,
too, might not be taken amiss this chill morning."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing loth, Conrad followed the stranger, and they
were soon imbibing some excellent <i>vin du pays</i> in a neighbouring
tavern.</p>

<p>"Conrad Bergmann," began the stranger. "Ay, thou art
surprised; but I know more than thy name. Wilt that I do
thee a good office?"</p>

<p>"Not the least objection, friend, if the price be within
reach. Nothing pay, nothing have, I reckon."</p>

<p>"The price? Nothing! At least nothing thou need care
for. Thou art thirsting for fame, riches, for the honours
of this world, for&mdash;for&mdash;the hand&mdash;the heart of thy
beloved."</p>

<p>Amongst the rest of Conrad's calamities, he had the misfortune
to be in love.</p>

<p>"Thou art mighty fluent with thy guesses," replied he,
not at all relishing these unpleasant truths; "and what if I
am doomed to pine after the good I can never attain? I
will bear my miseries, if not without repining, at least
without thy pity:" and he arose to depart.</p>

<p>"All that thou pinest after is thine. All!" said the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Mine! by what process?&mdash;whose the gift?&mdash;Ha, ha!"
and he drained the brimming glass, waiting a solution of
his interrogatory.</p>

<p>"I will be thy instructor. Behold the renowned Doctor
Gabriel Ras Mousa, who hath studied all arts and sciences
in the world, who hath unveiled Nature in her most secret
operations, and can make her submissive as a menial to his
will. In a period incredibly short, I engage to make thee
the most renowned painter in Christendom."</p>

<p>"And the time requisite to perform this?"</p>

<p>"One month! Ay, by the wand of Hermes, in one month,
under my teaching, shalt thou have thy desire. I watched
thy bargain with the dealer yonder, and have had pity on thy
youth and misfortunes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph&mdash;compassion! And the price?" again inquired
Conrad, with an anxious yet somewhat dubious expression of
tone.</p>

<p>"The price? Once every month shalt thou paint me a
picture."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"All."</p>

<p>Now Conrad began to indulge some pleasant fancies.
Dreams of hope and ambition hovered about him; but he
soon grew gloomy and desponding as heretofore. He waxed
incredulous.</p>

<p>"One month? Nothing less, than a miracle! The time is
too short. Impossible!"</p>

<p>"That is my business. I have both the will and the
power. Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>Conrad again drained the cup, and things looked brighter.
He felt invigorated. His courage came afresh, and he answered
firmly,</p>

<p>"A bargain."</p>

<p>"Give me thy hand."</p>

<p>"Oh, mein Herr&mdash;not so hard. Thy gripe is like a smithy
vice."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon of thy tender extremities. To-morrow then,
at this hour, we begin." Immediately after which intimation
the stranger departed.</p>

<p>Conrad returned to his own dwelling. He felt restless,
uneasy. Apprehensions of coming evil haunted him. Night
was tenfold more appalling. Horrid visions kept him in
continual alarm.</p>

<p>He arose feverish and unrefreshed. Yesterday's bargain
did not appear so pleasant in his eyes; but fear gave way
apace, and ere the appointed hour he was in his little work-room,
where the mysterious instructor found him in anxious
expectation. He drew the requisite materials from under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
his cloak, a well-primed canvass already prepared. The
pallet was covered, and Conrad sat down to obey his master's
directions.</p>

<p>"What shall be our subject?" inquired the pupil.</p>

<p>"A head. Proceed."</p>

<p>"A female?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But follow my instructions implicitly."</p>

<p>Conrad chalked out the outline. It was feebly, incorrectly
drawn; but the stranger took his crayon, and by a few
spirited touches gave life, vigour, and expression to the
whole. Conrad was in despair.</p>

<p>"O that it were in my power to have done this!" he
cried, putting one hand on his brow, and looking at the picture
as though he would have devoured it.</p>

<p>"Now for colour," said the stranger; and he carefully
directed his pupil how to lay in the ground, to mingle and
contrast the different tints, in a manner so far superior to
his former process, that Conrad soon began to feel a glow of
enthusiasm. His fervour increased, the latent spark of
genius was kindled. In short, the unknown seemed to have
imbued him with some hitherto unfelt attributes,&mdash;invested
him either with new powers, or awakened his hitherto
dormant faculties. As before, by a few touches, the crude,
spiritless mass became living and breathing under the master's
hand. Not many hours elapsed ere a pretty head,
respectably executed, appeared on the canvass. Conrad was
in high spirits.</p>

<p>He felt a new sense, a new faculty, as it were, created
within him. He worked industriously. Every hour seemed
to condense the labour and experience of years. He made
prodigious advances. His master came daily at the same
time, and at length his term of instruction drew to a close.
The last morning of the month arrived; and Conrad, unknown
to his neighbours, had attained to the highest rank
in his profession. His paintings, all executed under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
immediate superintendence of the stranger, were splendid
specimens of art.</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>In the year&mdash;&mdash;, all Paris was moved with the extraordinary
performances of a young artist, whose portraits
were the most wonderful, and his miniatures the most exquisite,
that eyes ever beheld. They looked absolutely as though
endowed with life, real flesh and blood to all appearance;
and happy were those who could get a painting from his
hand. The price was enormous, and the marvellous facility
with which they were dispatched was not the least extraordinary
part of the business. There was a mystery too,
about him, provokingly delightful, especially to the female
portion of the community. In place of living in a gay
and fashionable part of the city, his lodging was in a miserable
garret, overlooking one of the gloomiest streets of the
metropolis. His manners, too, were forbidding and reserved.
Instead of exhibiting the natural buoyancy of his years, he
looked care-worn and dejected; nor was he ever known to
smile.</p>

<p>After a period, whispers got abroad that several of his female
subjects came to strange and untimely deaths. They were
seized with some dangerous malady, accompanied by frightful
delusions. In general, they fancied themselves possessed.
Wailings, shrieks, and horrible blasphemies proceeded from
the lips of the sufferers. These reports were doubtless exaggerated,
the marvellous being a prodigiously accumulative
and inventive faculty; yet enough remained, apparently
authentic, to justify the most unfavourable suspicions.</p>

<p>About this time a young Italian lady, of a noble house,
arrived on a visit to her brother in the suite of the Florentine
embassy. This princely dame, possessed of great
wealth and beauty, was not long unprovided with lovers;
one especially, a handsome official in the royal household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
De Vessey by name, and as gallant a cavalier as ever lady
looked upon. But her term of absence being nigh expired,
the lovers were in great perplexity; and nothing seemed so
likely to contribute to their comfort, during such unavoidable
separation, as a miniature portrait of each from the hands of
this inimitable painter. Leonora sat first, and the lover
was in raptures. Hour by hour he watched the progress
of his work, in a little gloomy chamber, where the artist,
like some automaton fixture, was always found in the same
place, occupied too, as it might seem, without intermission.</p>

<p>"The gaze of that strange painter distresses me inexpressibly,"
said Leonora to her companion, as they went for
the last time to his apartment. "I have borne it hitherto
without a murmur, but words cannot describe the reluctance
with which I endure his glance; yet while I feel as though
my very soul abhorred it, it penetrates, nay, drinks up and
withers my spirit. Though I shrink from it, some influence
or fascination, call it as thou wilt, prevents escape; I cannot
turn away my eyes from his terrible gaze."</p>

<p>"Thou art fanciful, my love," said De Vessey; "the near
prospect of our parting makes thee apt to indulge these
gloomy impressions. Be of good cheer; nothing shall harm
thee in my presence. 'Tis the last sitting; put on a well-favoured
aspect, I beseech thee. Remember, this portraiture
will be my only solace during the long, long hours of
thine absence."</p>

<p>As they entered the artist's chamber, the picture lay before
him, which he seemed to contemplate with such absorbing
intensity, that he was hardly aware of their entrance.
He did not weep, but grief and pity were strangely
mingled in his glance. It was but for a moment; he quickly
resumed his usual attitude and expression. Whether the
previous conversation had made her lover liable to take the
tone and character of her own thoughts, we know not; but,
for the first time, he fancied Leonora's apprehensions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
not entirely without excuse. He looked on the artist, and
it excited almost a thrill of apprehension. But speedily
chiding himself for these untoward fancies, he felt that
little was apparent, either in look or manner, but what the
painter's peculiar and unexampled genius might sufficiently
explain.</p>

<p>Suddenly his attention was riveted on the lady. He
saw her lips quiver and turn pale, as though she would
have swooned. In a moment he was at her side. The support
seemed to reanimate the fainting maiden, her head
drooping on his shoulder. Almost gasping for utterance,
she whispered, "Take me hence, I want breath,&mdash;air, air!"
De Vessey lifted her in his arms, and bore her forth into the
open door-way. Trembling, shuddering, and looking round,
the first words she uttered were,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are watched,&mdash;by some unseen being in yonder
chamber, I am persuaded. Didst not mark an antique,
dismal-looking ebony cabinet, immediately behind the
painter?"</p>

<p>"I did, and admired its exquisite workmanship, as though
wrought by some cunning hand."</p>

<p>"As I fixed my eyes on those little traceries, it might be
fancy, but methought I saw the bright flash of a human
eye gazing on me."</p>

<p>"Oh, my Leonora, indulge not these gloomy impressions.
Throw off thy wayward fancies. 'Tis but the reflex image
the mind mistakes for outward realities. When disordered,
she discerns not the substance from the shadow. Thou art
well-nigh recovered. Come, come, let us in. To-day is the
last of our task; prithee take courage and return."</p>

<p>"On one condition only; if thou take the chair first, and
note well an open scroll to the right, where those fawns and
satyrs are carved."</p>

<p>"Agreed. And now shake off thy fears, my love."</p>

<p>De Vessey led her again to the apartment, and, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
without consideration, sat down, his face directly towards
the cabinet. He fixed his eyes thereon a few seconds only,
when Leonora saw him start up suddenly with a troubled
aspect, and grasp the hilt of his sword. Then turning to the
painter, he said sternly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"So!&mdash;We have intruders here, I trow."</p>

<p>"Intruders? None!" was the artist's reply, without betraying
either surprise or alarm.</p>

<p>"That we'll see presently," said the cavalier, hastening
to the cabinet; which, with hearty good will, he essayed to
open.</p>

<p>"Why this outrage?" inquired the painter, colouring
with a hectic flush.</p>

<p>"Because 'tis my good pleasure," was the haughty reply.
The door resisted his utmost efforts. "Doubtless held by
some one within. Open, or by this good sword I'll make a
passage through both door and carcase."</p>

<p>The hinges slowly gave way, the folding doors swung
open, and displayed a grinning skeleton!</p>

<p>"Ah! what lodger is this?"</p>

<p>"Mine art requires it," said the painter with a ghastly
smile; but in that smile was an expression so fearful, yet
mysterious, that even De Vessey quailed before it. Another
miniature portrait, a precise copy of the one in hand, hung
from the neck of the skeleton.</p>

<p>Leonora, with a loud shriek, covered her face; but the
lover, though far from satisfied himself, strove to assure his
mistress, and besought her not to indulge any apprehension.</p>

<p>"You are disturbed, lady," said the artist. "'Tis but a
harmless piece of earth, a mouldering fabric of dust, a thing,
a form we must all one day assume. But to-morrow, to-morrow,
if you will, we resume our work."</p>

<p>Leonora, relieved by the intimation, gladly consented, fain,
for a while, to escape from this terrible chamber.</p>

<p>"Nought living was there, of a truth," said the cavalier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
in evident perplexity, as they regained their coach. "But
I saw plain enough, or imagination played me the prank, a
semblance of a bright and flashing eye on the spot pointed
out. Something incomprehensible hangs about the whole!"</p>

<p>Leonora agreed in this conclusion, expressing a fear lest
harm should happen to themselves thereby. They were not
ignorant of the whispers afloat, but hitherto treated them
either with ridicule or indifference. Suspicion, however,
once awake, mystery once apprehended, every circumstance,
even the most trivial, is seized upon, the mind bending all
to one grand object which haunts and excites the imagination.</p>

<p>Having left his companion at her brother's dwelling, De
Vessey came to his own, moody and dispirited. A vague
sense of some grievous but impending misfortune hung
heavily upon him. Night brought no mitigation of his
fears. Spectres, skeletons, and demon-painters haunted his
slumbers. He awoke in greater torment than ever. The
duplicate portrait was brought to his remembrance with a
vividness, an intensity so appalling, that he almost expected
to behold the skeleton wearer at his bedside.</p>

<p>Involved in a labyrinth of inextricable surmises, and not
knowing what course to pursue, he arose early, and walked
forth without aim or design towards the church of Notre
Dame.</p>

<p>The red sun was just bursting through a thick atmosphere
of mist, illuminating its two dark western towers,
which looked even more gloomy under a bright and glowing
sky, like melancholy in immediate contrast with hilarity
and joy.</p>

<p>He passed the Morgue, or dead-house, where bodies found
in the Seine are exposed, in order that they may be owned
or recognised. Impelled by curiosity, he entered. One space
alone was occupied. He could not surely be deceived when
he saw the body of the unfortunate painter! Those features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
were too well remembered to be mistaken. Here was new
ground for conjecture, fresh wonder and perplexity. He
left this melancholy exhibition and entered the cathedral.
Mass was celebrating at one of the altars. De Vessey
joined in adoration, strolling away afterwards towards the
vaults: one of them was open. From some vague, unaccountable
impulse, he thus accosted the sexton:</p>

<p>"Whose grave is this, friend?"</p>

<p>"A maid's&mdash;mayhap."</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"The only remaining descendant of the Barons Montargis."</p>

<p>"I have some knowledge of that noble gentlewoman; she
was just about to be married. What might be the nature of
her malady?"</p>

<p>"Why, verily there be as many guesses as opinions. The
doctors were all at fault, and, 'tis said, even now in great
dispute. The king's physician tried hard to save her. Old
Fr&egrave;re Jeronymo, the confessor, will have it she was possessed;
but all his fumigations, exorcisms, paters, and holy
water could not cast out the foul fiend. She died raving
mad!"</p>

<p>"A miserable portion for one so young and high-born.
Was there no visible cause?"</p>

<p>"Cause!&mdash;Ay, marry; if common gossip be not an
arrant jade. Her portrait had been taken by that same
limner who, they say, has been taught in the devil's school,
and can dispatch a likeness with the twirl of his brush."</p>

<p>"And what of that?" cried De Vessey, in an agony of
impatience.</p>

<p>"Why, the same fate has happened to several of our city
dames. That is all."</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"They have gone mad, and either felt, or fancied, some
demon had gotten them in keeping. For my part, I pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
not to a knowledge of the matter. But you seem strangely
moved, methinks."</p>

<p>The cavalier was nigh choking with emotion. Sick at
heart, and with a fearful presentiment of impending evil, he
turned suddenly away.</p>

<p>His next visit, as may be supposed, was to his mistress.
He found her in great agitation. The portrait had been
sent home the preceding night, and, completely finished,
lay before her,&mdash;an exquisite, nay marvellous, specimen of
art. She was gazing on her own radiant counterpart as he
entered. They both agreed that something more than ordinary
ran through the whole proceedings, though unable to
comprehend their meaning. De Vessey related his discovery
in the Morgue, but not his subsequent interview with the
sexton.</p>

<p>Ere night, Leonora was seized with a strange and frightful
disease. Symptoms of insanity were soon developed.
She uttered fearful cries; calling on the painter in language
wild and incoherent, but of terrific import.</p>

<p>The lover was at his wits' end. He vowed to spare no
efforts to save her, though scarcely knowing what course
to pursue, or in what quarter to apply for help.</p>

<p>His first care was to seek the dwelling of a certain renowned
doctor, a German, whose extraordinary cures and
mode of treatment had won for him great wealth and
reputation. Though by some accounted a quack and impostor,
nevertheless De Vessey hoped, as a last resource,
so cunning a physician might be able to point at once the
source and cure of this occult malady.</p>

<p>Doctor Hermann Sichel lived in one of those high, antique,
dreary looking habitations, now pulled down, situate in the
Rue d'Enfer. A common staircase conducted to several
suites of apartments, tenanted by various occupants, and at
the very summit dwelt this exalted personage.</p>

<p>A pull at the ponderous bell-handle gave notice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
De Vessey's approach, when, after due deliberation, it might
seem, and a long trial to the impatient querent, a little
wicket was cautiously slid back, behind a grating in the
door. A face, partially exhibited, demanded his errand.</p>

<p>"Thy master, knave!"</p>

<p>"He is in the very entrails of a sublime study. Not for
my beard, grey though it be, dare I break in upon him."</p>

<p>"Mine errand is urgent," said De Vessey; "and, look
thee, say a noble cavalier hath great need of succour at his
hands."</p>

<p>"Grammercy, sir cavalier, and hath not everybody an
errand of like moment?&mdash;thy business, peradventure, less
urgent than fifty others whose suit I have denied this
blessed day. I tell thee, my master may not be disturbed!"</p>

<p>De Vessey held up a coin, temptingly, before the grating.
It would not go through, and the crusty Cerberus gently
undid a marvellous array of chains, bars, and other ingenious
devices, opening a slit wide enough for its insertion.</p>

<p>"Wider! thou trusty keeper," said the artful suitor
outside. "I cannot fly though a key-hole!"</p>

<p>A hand was carefully protruded. The cavalier, espying
his opportunity, thrust first his sword, afterwards himself,
through the aperture, in spite of curses and entreaties from
the greedy porter. He was immediately within a dark
entrance or vestibule; the astonished and angry menial
venting his wrath, in no measured phrases, on the intruder.
De Vessey, in a peremptory tone, demanded to be led forthwith
into the doctor's presence. The old man delayed for
awhile, almost speechless from several causes. His breath
was nigh spent. Wrath on the one hand, fear of his
master's displeasure on the other, kept him, like antagonist
forces, perpetually midway between both.</p>

<p>"Lead the way, knave, or, by the beard of St. Louis, I'll
seek him through the house! Quick! thou hast legs; if
not, speak! mine errand is urgent, and will not wait."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>A stout and determined cavalier, with a strong gripe, and
a sword none of the shortest, was not to be trifled with;
and, after many expostulations, warnings, threats, had failed
of their effect, he at length doggedly consented.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt give me the coin, then, sir cavalier?"</p>

<p>"Ay, when thou hast earned it. Away!"</p>

<p>Passing through a narrow passage, lighted from above,
his conductor paused before a curiously carved oaken door,
at which three taps announced a message.</p>

<p>"Now enter, and pray for us both a safe deliverance.
But, prithee, tell him it was not my fault thou hast gotten
admission."</p>

<p>The door slowly opened, as though without an effort, and
De Vessey was immediately in the presence of the physician,
evidently to the surprise of the learned doctor himself, who
angrily demanded his business and the ground of his
intrusion.</p>

<p>"Mine hour is not yet come, young man. Wherefore
shouldest thou, either by stratagem or force, thrust thyself,
unbidden, into our presence?"</p>

<p>"To buy or beg thine aid, if it be possible. The case
admits not of delay. I crave thy pardon, most reverend
doctor, if that content thee; and, rest assured, no largess,
no reward shall be too great, if thou restore one, I fear me,
beyond earthly aid."</p>

<p>"Thus am I ever solicited," replied the sage, with a
portentous scowl. He was clad in a gown of dark stuff,
with slippers to match; his poll surmounted by a small
black velvet skull-cap, from which his white, intensely
white, hair escaped in great profusion. His visage was
not swarthy, but of a leaden, pale complexion, where little
could be discerned of the wondrous microcosm within.
Books, and manuscripts of ancient form and character, emblazoned
in quaint and mystic devices, lay open on a long
oak table, on which rested one elbow of the wise man; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
other was thrown over an arm of the high-backed chair
whereon he sat. The room contained plenty of litter in the
shape of phials, boxes, and other strange furniture. A
cupola furnace was just heated, the doctor, apparently,
concocting some subtle compound.</p>

<p>"I am expected to wrest these helpless mortals even from
the ravening jaws of the grave! My skill never tried
until beyond other aid!"</p>

<p>"But this disorder is of a sudden emergency. A lady of
high birth and lineage, a few hours since, was seized with a
raging frenzy."</p>

<p>"A female, then!"</p>

<p>"Ay, and of such sweet temper and excellent parts, there
be none to match with her, body or mind, in Christendom."</p>

<p>"When did this malady attack her?"</p>

<p>"Almost immediately after a portrait, made by the
celebrated painter, was finished. Of him thou hast, doubtless,
heard."</p>

<p>"The painter!&mdash;Ay!&mdash;There be more than thou have
rued his skill. Young man, thy pretty one is lost."</p>

<p>"Lost! Oh, say not so! I will give thee thine utmost
desire&mdash;riches&mdash;wealth thou hast never possessed, if thou
restore her!"</p>

<p>"She is beyond my skill. Hast visited him since?"</p>

<p>"I have seen him. She is the last victim, if such be her
fate. This very morning, betimes, I saw his body in the
Morgue."</p>

<p>"They have found him, then!" said the doctor, sharply.
"Yet our bodies are but exuvi&aelig;. When cast off, this
thinking, sentient principle within has another tabernacle
assigned to it, until the great consummation of all things.
But these are fables, idle tales, to the unlearned. Nevertheless,
I pity thy cruel fate, and, if aid can be afforded, will
call another to thine help. Hence! Thou shalt hear from
me anon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>"And without loss of time; for every moment, methinks,
our succour may come too late."</p>

<p>"I will forthwith seek out one whom I have heretofore
taken knowledge of. Every science has its votaries,&mdash;its
adepts; and this evil case hath its remedy only by those
skilled in arts called, however falsely, supernatural. Even
now, there be intelligences around us, which the corporeal
eye seeth not, nor can see, unless purged from the dross, the
fumes of mortality. Some, peradventure, by long and patient
study, have arrived on the very borders, the confines
that separate visible from invisible things; and become, as
it were, the medium of intercourse for mortals, who are, by
this means, mightily aided in matters beyond ordinary research.
Put thine ear to this shell. Mark its voice, like
the sound of many waters. Are not these the invisible
source, the essence of its being? Has not every thing in
like manner, even the most inanimate, a tongue, a language,
peculiar to itself&mdash;a soul, a spirit, pervading its form, which
moulds and fashions every substance according to its own
nature? Now, this voice thou canst not interpret, being
unskilled; knowing not the languages peculiar to every
form and modification of matter. Else would this beautiful
type of the ever-rolling sea discourse marvellously to thine
ear. But thou hast not the key to unclose its mystic
tongue; hence, like any other unknown speech, 'tis but a
confused jumble of unmeaning sound. I have little more
knowledge than thyself, but there be those who can interpret.
Vain man&mdash;presumptuous, ignorant&mdash;scoffs at knowledge
beyond his reach, and thinks his own dim, nay
darkened reason, glimmering as in a dungeon, the narrow
horizon that circumscribes his vision, the utmost boundary
of all knowledge and existence, while, beyond, lies the infinite
and unknown, utterly transcending his capacity and
comprehension."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>De Vessey drank up every word of this harangue; and
something akin to hope rose in his bosom, as he withdrew.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt have a message ere nightfall. An awful trial
awaits thee ere the spell can be countervailed."</p>

<p>The cavalier withdrew, suffering many wistful remarks
from the old door-keeper, who marvelled greatly at the
interview so graciously conceded by his master; while at
the same time holding out his palm for the promised largess.</p>

<p>De Vessey waited impatiently at his own dwelling for the
expected message. Evening drew on, dark and stormy.
The wind roared along the narrow streets in sharp and
irregular gusts; while, pacing his chamber in an agony of
suspense, he fancied every sound betokened the approaching
communication. At length, when expectation was almost
weary, a louder rumbling was heard; a coach drew up at
the door; a hasty knock, and a heavy tramp; then footsteps
ascending the staircase. The door opened, and two <i>gens-d'armes</i>
entered.</p>

<p>"We have authority and instructions for the arrest of
one Sigismund de Vessey, on a charge of murder, made this
day by deposition before the Mayor and Prefecture of the
Ville de Paris. The individual so named, we apprehend, is
before us."</p>

<p>"The same; though assuredly there is some mistake.
Of whose death am I accused?"</p>

<p>"Of one Conrad Bergmann, a painter, whose body, last
night thrown into the Seine, was to-day exposed in the
Morgue. The rest will be explained anon."</p>

<p>"But an engagement, one too of a most important nature,
demands my presence."</p>

<p>"No discretion is allowed us in this matter. The carriage
waits."</p>

<p>However reluctant, De Vessey was forced to obey.
Though confident of a speedy release, this arrest at so
important a juncture was provoking enough. Leonora's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
recovery might probably depend on his exertions for the
next few hours, which were now suddenly wrested from
him.</p>

<p>Leaving word that he would shortly return, the cavalier
stept into the vehicle, which immediately drove off.</p>

<p>In a little space the coach stopped, and De Vessey was
invited to alight. He was led up a narrow staircase; a
door flew open. He entered. Could it be; surely imagination
betrayed his senses! He could scarcely believe himself
once more in the apartment of the painter! Yet there
was no mistaking what he saw. The ebony cabinet, the
easel, table, chair, all left as he saw them yesterday. But
the living occupants were strangely diverse. Two or three
functionaries of the civil power, and, in one corner, a black
cloth, spread on the floor, concealed some unknown object.
The whole was lighted by a feeble lamp from the ceiling.
A dusky haze from the damp foggy atmosphere rendered
objects ill-defined, indistinct, almost terrific to an excited
imagination. In addition to the usual articles of furniture,
was a desk, with writing materials, at which one of the
officers of justice appeared dictating something to his
secretary.</p>

<p>On De Vessey's entrance, the scribe made some minute
preparatory to his examination, which commenced as follows:</p>

<p>"Sigismund de Vessey?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"Being accused upon oath before us of murder, thou art
brought hither to confront thine accusers, and to answer
this heinous charge. First, let the body be produced."</p>

<p>The cloth was removed, and De Vessey beheld the corpse
lying on a mattress.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou this body?"</p>

<p>"I do," said the cavalier firmly.</p>

<p>"When was he seen by thee alive, the last time?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday, about noon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In this chamber."</p>

<p>"Not since?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not living."</p>

<p>"Dead, sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"This morning in the Morgue."</p>

<p>"Not previously?"</p>

<p>"I have not. But pray to what purport this examination?"</p>

<p>"This will appear presently. When taken out of the
river, marks were found upon the throat, as though from
strangulation. Knowest thou aught of these?"</p>

<p>"I do not," said the accused indignantly.</p>

<p>This answer being written down, the examination was
resumed.</p>

<p>"We have testimony that the unfortunate victim and
thyself were seen together about midnight; and, further, a
short but violent struggle was heard, and a heavy plunge;
afterwards an individual, with whom thou art identified,
was seen departing in great haste, and entering the house
well known as thy residence in the Rue de&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A most foul and wicked fabrication, for purposes of
which as yet I am ignorant. Of such charges I hardly need
affirm that I am innocent."</p>

<p>"Let the accuser stand forth."</p>

<p>To the surprise and horror of De Vessey, there appeared
from a recess the German doctor, Hermann Sichel, who,
without flinching, recapitulated the foregoing accusation.
Moreover, he swore in the most positive terms to his identity,
and that not a doubt rested on his mind but De Vessey
was the murderer.</p>

<p>"In this very apartment," said the witness, "he, De
Vessey, drew his sword upon the painter yesterday, doubtless
either from grudge or jealousy; being enamoured of a
fair Italian dame, Leonora da Rimini."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most abominable of liars!" said the accused, eyeing him
with a furious look. "How darest thou, to my face, bring
this foul accusation. Thou shalt answer for it with thy
blood!"</p>

<p>"Hear him! What need of further testimony? His own
betrayed him," said the doctor, with unblushing effrontery.</p>

<p>"We have other witness thou wilt not dare to gainsay,"
said the presiding officer. "This learned person is amply
corroborated by evidence that must effectually silence all
denial. He hath referred us to her who was present, Leonora
da Rimini."</p>

<p>"Leonora! what, my own&mdash;my betrothed? She my
accuser?"</p>

<p>"Spare thy speech and listen. We could not bring the
maiden hither, insomuch the nature of her malady admits
not of removal: but her evidence and accusation are duly
attested, taken at her own request, not many hours ago.
The substance of her deposition is as follows: a confession
to her of thine intention to murder Conrad Bergmann, the
artist aforesaid, being jealous of his attentions; and furthermore,
in the agony of guilt, thou didst confess in her presence,
having first strangled, and afterwards thrown him
into the river, hoping thereby to conceal thy crime; then
forcing her to swear she would keep the matter secret, and
threatening her life in case it were divulged. This outrage,
and this alone, hath nigh driven her frantic; her life being
in jeopardy from thy violence. What sayest thou, Sigismund
de Vessey?"</p>

<p>"A lie, most foul and audacious! trumped up by that
impostor! Leonora? Impossible. I would not believe
though it were from her own lips. Some demon hath possessed
her. This disorder is more than common madness."</p>

<p>He looked around. The whole was like the phantasma
of some terrible dream. Bewildered, and hardly knowing
what course to pursue, in vain he attempted to shake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
testimony of the hoary villain before him; and having at
present none other means of rebutting the accusation, he
was ordered into close custody until the morrow.</p>

<p>Utterly unprepared with evidence, he knew not where
to apply. That he was the victim of some foul plot, so far
appeared certain; but for what purpose, and at whose instigation,
was inexplicable.</p>

<p>Ere an hour had elapsed, De Vessey found himself in one
of the cells of a public dungeon, with ample leisure to form
plans for proving his innocence. He determined early on
the morrow to acquaint his friends, and employ a celebrated
advocate to expose this villanous doctor, who no doubt had
designs either on his purse or person.</p>

<p>In a while, the prisoner fell asleep from fatigue and
exhaustion. He was awakened by a sudden glare across
his eyelids. At first, imagining he was under the influence
of some extravagant dream, he made little effort to arouse
himself. A figure stood beside the couch; a lamp lifted
above his head. A friar's cowl concealed his features; his
person too was enveloped in a coarse garment, with a huge
rosary at his girdle.</p>

<p>"Mortal, awake and listen," said the unknown visitor,
"Art weary of life, or does this present world content thee?"</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" said De Vessey, scarcely raising himself
from the pallet.</p>

<p>"I am thy friend, thy deliverer an' thou wilt."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said the knight, springing from his recumbent
posture.</p>

<p>"Stay!" replied the intruder, "there be conditions ere
thou pass hence. Miserable offspring of Adam, ye still
cling to your prison and your clay. Wherefore shrink from
the separation, afraid to shake off your bonds, your loathsome
carcase, and spring forth at once to life? Art thou
prepared to fulfil one&mdash;but one condition for thy release?"</p>

<p>"Name it! Manifest my innocence; and if it be gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
thou shalt have thy desire. No hired advocate ere yet held
such a fee!"</p>

<p>"Keep thy gold for baser uses; it buyeth not my benefits.
But remember, thy life is not worth a week's purchase,
neither is thy mistress' forsooth, shouldest thou be
witless enough to refuse. An ignominious death, a base
exit for thyself,&mdash;for her, madness and a speedy grave.
One fate awaits ye both. Life and health, if thou consent
are yours."</p>

<p>"Thou speakest riddles. It were vain trying to comprehend
their import. Name thy conditions. Aught, that
honour may purchase, will I give."</p>

<p>The stranger threw back his cowl, displaying the features
of the renowned Doctor Hermann Sichel: a gleam of lurid
intelligence lighted his grim grey eyes, that might betoken
either insanity or excitement.</p>

<p>Without reflecting for one moment on the hazard and
imprudence of his conduct, De Vessey immediately rushed
forward, grappled with his adversary, and threw him.</p>

<p>"Now will I have deadly vengeance, fiend! Take
that!" said he, drawing forth a concealed poignard, and
thrusting with all his might. Scorn puckered the features
of the pretended monk. The weapon's point was driven
back, refusing to enter, as though his enemy held a charmed
existence.</p>

<p>"Put back thy weapon; thou wilt have need of it elsewhere,
silly one."</p>

<p>De Vessey was confounded at this unlooked-for result.
His foe seemed invulnerable, and he slunk back.</p>

<p>"I forgive thee, poor fool! Put it back, I say. There&mdash;there&mdash;now
to work&mdash;time hastens, and there is little space
for parley."</p>

<p>"What is thy will?"</p>

<p>"Thy welfare, thy life; listen. Yonder unhappy wretch
I have loaden with benefits, rescued from poverty, disgrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
lifted him to the pinnacle of his ambition, the highest rank
in art. Base ingrate, he threatened to betray, to denounce,
and I crushed the reptile. He is now what thou shalt be
shortly, unless my power be put forth for thy rescue. Not
all the united efforts of man can deliver thee. Beyond
earthly aid, thou diest the death of a dog!"</p>

<p>"Why dost thou accuse me of a crime, knowing that I
am innocent?"</p>

<p>"To drive thee, helpless, into my power. Think not to
escape save on one condition."</p>

<p>"Name it," said De Vessey.</p>

<p>"Self-preservation is the great, the paramount law of our
nature; the most powerful impulse implanted in our being.
All, all obey this impulse; and who can control or forbid
its operation? Will not the most timid, the most scrupulous,
if no alternative be afforded, slay the adversary who
seeks his life; and does not the law both of earth and
heaven hold him guiltless? Thou art now denounced.
Innocent, thy life must be sacrificed. Thou diest, or
another; there is no choice."</p>

<p>"But shall <i>I</i> murder the innocent."</p>

<p>"And suppose it be. What thinkest thou? Two persons,
equally guiltless, one of them must die. Self-preservation
will prompt instinctively to action. Does not the
drowning man cling to his companion; nay, rescue himself
at the expense of another's life?"</p>

<p>De Vessey felt bewildered, if not convinced. Need we
wonder if he yielded. Life or death. Honour, disgrace.
His mistress restored; his innocence proved. Life, with
him, had scarcely been tasted. A glorious career awaited
him; his lady-love smiling through the bright vista of the
future; and&mdash;&mdash;the tempter prevailed!</p>

<p>But who must be the victim? The appalling truth was
not then disclosed. De Vessey promised to obey.</p>

<p>"But remember, no power, not even flight, can screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
thee from my vengeance shouldst break thy vow. Take
warning by the painter; the poor fool but hesitated, and his
doom was swift as it was sure. Take this cowl and friar's
garment; I was admitted by the jailor for thy shrift. The
lamp will guide thee. Be bold, and fear not. I will remain;
to-morrow they will find out their mistake, but I
have other means of escape."</p>

<p>"And Leonora. How shall she be recovered?"</p>

<p>"That is a work of peril, and will need thine utmost
vigilance. Rememberest thou the skeleton?"</p>

<p>"In the ebony cabinet?" inquired the cavalier, with a
cold shudder.</p>

<p>"He hath her portrait, and will not lightly be persuaded
to give his prey. <i>Every month I am bound to furnish him
a bride!</i> My own life pays the forfeit of omission.
Leonora is the next victim, unless thou prevail, betrothed
to that grisly type of death!"</p>

<p>"Oh, horrible! Mine the bride of a loathsome skeleton!
Of an atomy! A fiend! Monster, I will denounce thee. I
care not for my own life. Of what worth if torn from hers.
Wretch, give back my bride or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Spare these transports. I am now thine only friend.
Thou art now cut off from thy kin, shunned by mankind.
To whom then wilt thou turn for help? Mine thou art, for
ever!"</p>

<p>De Vessey gasped for utterance.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," continued his tormentor, "I will direct
and help thee in this matter also. But 'tis a fearful venture.
Hast thou courage?"</p>

<p>"If to rescue her, aught that human arm can achieve
shall be done."</p>

<p>"He holds the portrait, I tell thee, with a steady gripe.
Those skeleton fingers will be hard to unloose."</p>

<p>"I will break them, or perish. This good&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Touch them not for thy life. Death, sure but lingering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
awaits whomsoever they fasten upon. Take this key. It
will admit thee to the apartment. To-night the deed must
be accomplished, or to-morrow the maiden is beyond
succour."</p>

<p>"And how is this charmed picture to be wrested from
him?"</p>

<p>"An ebony wand lies at his feet; he will obey its touch.
But whatsoever thou seest, be nothing daunted, nor let any
silly terror scare thee from thy purpose. Now to thy task.
But keep these marvels to thyself. If thou whisper, ay to
the winds, our compact, thou art not safe."</p>

<p>Soon De Vessey, enveloped in his disguise, found egress
without difficulty. Once outside the prison, he hurried on
scarcely giving himself time for reflection.</p>

<p>The night was dark and stormy. Torches, distributed
about the streets, rocked and swung to and fro in their
sockets, the flames, with a strange and flickering glare,
giving an unnatural distorted appearance to objects within
reach; and, to some solitary individual, at this late hour
hurrying alone, the grim aspect of a demon or a spectre
to the disturbed imagination of the lover. His courage, at
times on the point of deserting him, revived, when he
remembered that another's life, dearer than his own, depended
on his exertions. The streets, almost deserted,
swam with continually accumulating torrents: but he felt
not that terrible tempest; the turmoil, the conflict within,
was louder than the roar and tumult of outward elements.</p>

<p>Almost ere he was aware, he found himself opposite the
entrance of the painter's habitation; a shudder, like a
death-chill, shot through his frame. He applied his key.
A distant gleam, a dim lurid light, seemed to quiver before
him. He heard the quick jar, the withdrawing bolt, that
gave him admittance, as though it were a spectral voice
warning him to desist.</p>

<p>The unknown dangers he anticipated, rendered more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
terrific by their vague indefinite character, were enough to
appal a stouter bosom. De Vessey would have faced and
defied earthly perils, but these were almost beyond his
fortitude to endure. Love, however, gave excitement, if
not courage, and he resolved either to succeed or perish in
the attempt. The stairs were partially illumined by an
uncertain glimmer from a narrow window into the street.
He felt his way, and every step sent the life-blood curdling
to his heart. He reached the topmost stair; laid one hand
on the latch. He listened; all was still, save the hollow
gusts that rumbled round the dwelling.</p>

<p>With a feeling somewhat akin to desperation, he entered.
A lamp yet burning emitted a feeble glare, but was well-nigh
spent, giving a more dismal aspect to this lonely
chamber. It was apparently unoccupied. The chair, the
black funeral pall left by the officers of justice over the
pallet, the mysterious cabinet, the desk where the painter
usually sat, all remained undisturbed. De Vessey's attention
was more particularly directed towards the cabinet;
there alone, according to his instructions, were the means
of deliverance. A cold, clammy perspiration, a freezing
shiver, came upon him as he approached. He laid one
hand on the latch; it resisted as before. He tried force,
a loud groan was heard in the chamber. Every fibre of his
frame seemed to grow rigid; every limb stiffened with
horror, and he drew back.</p>

<p>This was a sorry beginning to the adventure, and he
inwardly repented of his rashness. Looking round in extreme
agony, his eyes rested on the black pall. Could it be!
or was it from the expiring glimmer of the lamp? The
drapery appeared to move. Another, and a deeper groan!
De Vessey for a space was unable to move; but his courage
came apace, inasmuch as it was some relief, and a diversion
from the awful mysteries of that grim cabinet. He approached
the pallet hastily, throwing off the heavy coverlet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
The recumbent body was yet beneath, but convulsed, as
though struggling to free itself from an oppressive burden.
De Vessey watched, while his blood froze with terror.
Gradually these convulsive movements extended to the
features. The lips quivered, as though essaying to speak;
the eye-balls rolling rapidly under their lids. A slight
flush dawned upon the cheek; the hands were tightly
closed, and another groan preceded one desperate attempt
to throw off the load which prevented returning animation.
At length the eyes opened with a ghastly stare; but
evidently conveying no outward impression to the inward
sense. With a loud shriek the body started up: then,
uttering a wild and piercing cry, rolled on the floor, foaming,
and struggling for life as though with some powerful
adversary.</p>

<p>"Save me! Save me!" was uttered in a tone so harrowing
and dreadful, more than mortal agony, that De Vessey
would have fled, but his limbs refused their office.</p>

<p>"He strangles me! Fiend&mdash;have&mdash;have mercy! Wilt
thou not? Oh mercy, mercy Heaven!" His senses, though
evidently bewildered, resumed their functions. With a
glare of intense anguish he appeared as though supplicating
help and deliverance.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" was the first inquiry and symptom of
returning reason. "I know thee, De Vessey. But why
art thou here? Another victim. Yes, to torture me.
Where am I? In my own chamber! Oh&mdash;that horrid
cabinet! Yet&mdash;yet these cruel torments. Will they never
end?"</p>

<p>De Vessey immediately perceived there was no delusion;
the mortal form of the artist was really before him. Terrible
though it were, yet it was a relief to have companionship
with his kind, a being of flesh and blood beside him. He
might now, peradventure, accomplish his task. Providence,
may be, had opened a way for his deliverance, and hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
once more dawned on his spirit. He helped the miserable
artist to regain his couch, and sought to soothe him, beseeching
the helpless victim not to give way to frenzy,
doubtless resulting from his strange and emaciated condition.
A miracle or a spell had been wrought for his
resuscitation; but the events of the last few hours were
alike enigmas, beyond the common operations of nature to
explain.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I attempted suicide," said the artist, "taking
poison to escape a life insupportable to me. Fain would I
have broken the chain which binds me to this miserable
existence. But yon tyrant hath given me a charmed life.
I cannot even die!"</p>

<p>"Thy body was dragged from the Seine."</p>

<p>"How?" inquired the artist with an incredulous look.</p>

<p>"And exposed this morning in the Morgue," continued
De Vessey.</p>

<p>"When will my sufferings cease? How have I prayed
for deliverance from this infernal thraldom."</p>

<p>"Yon deceiver hath doubtless thrown thee into the river,
and supposing thou wert dead, he designs me to supply thy
place; to carry on the dark mystery of iniquity, a glimpse
of which hath already been revealed."</p>

<p>"Would that I had been left to perish,&mdash;that my doom
were ended. Avarice, ambition! how enslaved are your
victims. How have I longed for my miserable cottage,
my poverty, my obscurity,&mdash;cold and pinching want, but
a quiet conscience to season my scanty meal. I bartered
all for gold, for fame and&mdash;misery! A cruel bondage!
compared to which I could envy the meanest thing that
crawls on this abject earth. In my trance, I dreamed of
green fields and babbling streams; of my brethren, my play-mates,
my days of innocence and sport, when all was freshness
and anticipation,&mdash;life one bright vista beyond, opening
to sunny regions of rapture and delight. And now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
what am I?&mdash;a wretch, degraded, undone,&mdash;a spectacle of
misery, beyond what human thought can conceive. Doomed
to years, ages it may be, of woe,&mdash;to scenes of horror such
as tongue ne'er told, and even imagination might scarce
endure, and my miseries but a foretaste of that hereafter!"</p>

<p>Here the guilty victim writhed in a paroxysm of agony;
his veins swollen almost to bursting. Whether real or imaginary,
whether a victim to insanity, or of some supernatural
agent, its influence was not the less terrible in
its effects. Starting suddenly from his grovelling posture,
he cried, fixing his eyes on De Vessey with a searching
glance,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What brings thee hither?"</p>

<p>"Leonora is in jeopardy by your spells. I seek her deliverance."</p>

<p>"She is beyond rescue. Leonora da Rimini is <span class="smcap">the skeleton's
bride</span>!"</p>

<p>Here the painter threw such a repulsive glance towards
the cabinet, that the cavalier shrank back as though expecting
some grisly spectre from its portals; yet, himself
the subject of an extraordinary fascination, he could not
withdraw his gaze.</p>

<p>"Fly, fly, or thou art lost! My tormentor will be here
anon,&mdash;I would have saved her, and he fixed his burning
gripe here, I feel it still; not a night passes that he comes
not hither. Away! shouldest thou meet him, thy doom is
fixed, and for ever. I would not that another fell into his
toils. Couldest thou know, ay, but as a whisper, the
secrets of this prison-house, thy spirit would melt, thy flesh
would shrink as though the hot wind of the desert had
passed over. What I have endured, and what I must endure,
are alike unutterable."</p>

<p>"Thy keeper comes not to-night. He hath sent me to
this chamber of death instead. He knows not thou art
alive."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thee!&mdash;To&mdash;But I must not reveal; my tongue
cleaves to my mouth. Nay, nay, it cannot be; none but a
fiend could do his behest. Away! for thy life, away!"</p>

<p>De Vessey related the events of the last few hours. The
artist ruminated awhile; then abruptly exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"He hath some diabolical design thereupon which I am
not yet able to fathom. That it is for thine undoing Sir
Knight, for thy misery here and hereafter, doubt not. Thou
hast promised, but not yet offered him a victim. Thus far
thou art safe; but he will pursue thee, and think not to
escape his vengeance. How to proceed is beyond my counsel.
Should midnight come, thou wouldest see horrors in
this chamber that might quail the stoutest heart. Thou
art bereft of life or reason if thou tarry."</p>

<p>"I leave not without an attempt, even should I fail, to
wrench her, who is dearer to me than either, from that
demon's grasp. I will not hence alone."</p>

<p>"Alas! I fear there is little hope; yet shall he not escape
yonder prison before to-morrow. Even his arts cannot
convey him through its walls; the magician's body, if
such he be, is subject to like impediments with our own.
This night, for good or ill, is thine."</p>

<p>"To work, then, to work," said De Vessey, as though inspired
with new energy, "to the rescue, and by this good
cross," kissing the handle of his sword, "I defy ye!"</p>

<p>By main force he attempted, and, in the end, tore open
the door of the cabinet. The grinning skeleton was before
him, the miniature in its grasp. A moment's pause. The
cavalier carefully surveyed his prize. Suspended by an
iron chain, the links entwined round its bony arm, rendered
the picture difficult, if not impossible, to detach without
touching the limbs. Gathering fresh courage from the
countenance and smile of his beloved, he snatched the portrait,
but the wearer was too tenacious of the charmed treasure,
and resisted his utmost efforts. He thought a savage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
a malicious grin crept upon his features. A smile more
than usually hideous mocked him. From those hollow
sockets, too, or his imagination played strange antics, a faint
glare shot forth. A dizzy terror crept over him. His brain
reeled. His energies were becoming prostrate; and unless
one desperate attempt could be made, all hope of rescue
were past. He sought the ebony wand, but, forgetful or
incautious, laid hold of the chain which encircled the skeleton's
wrist. A bell answered to the pressure,&mdash;a deep
hollow reverberation, like a death-knell in his ear.</p>

<p>"Hark! that iron tongue,&mdash;lost&mdash;lost! Oh! mercy,
mercy!" shrieked the death-painter, covering his eyes.</p>

<p>At this moment, De Vessey heard a noise like the jarring
of bolts and hinges. Ere he was aware, the skeleton's arms
were fastened round him; the doors closed, the floor gave
way under his feet. He felt the pressure relaxing; he fell,
the hissing wind rushed in his ears. Stunned with his fall,
he lay for a while in the dark, scarcely able to move. It
was not long ere he was able to grope about. Rotting carcases
and bones met his touch&mdash;a noisome charnel-house
gorged with human bodies in all the various stages of decay.
His heart sickened with a fearful apprehension that he was
left to perish by a lingering death, like those around him.
Despair for the first time benumbed his faculties. His
courage gave way at the dreadful anticipation, and he
grasped the very carcase on which he trod for succour.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a loud yell burst above him. A blaze of burning
timbers flashed forth,&mdash;crackling, they hissed, and fell
into the vault. Through an opening overhead, he saw the
skeleton seized by devouring flames. They twined, they
clung round it. Their forky tongues licked the bones that
appeared to writhe and crawl in living agony.</p>

<p>Soon the chain, which held the portrait, gave way, and
it dropped at his feet unhurt. A shriek issued from the
flaming cabinet, and he saw the painter with a burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
torch above. A maniac joy lighted up his features: he
shouted to De Vessey, and with frantic gestures beckoned
that he should escape.</p>

<p>"If thou canst climb yonder stair," he cried, "before the
flames cut off thy retreat, thou art safe. See, Leonora is
already free. Haste&mdash;this way&mdash;there,&mdash;there, now leap&mdash;mind
thy footing, 'tis too frail, creep round, those rafters
are unbroken; another spring, and thou mayest reach them
in safety."</p>

<p>The flames were close upon him. He was nigh suffocated.
A perilous attempt,&mdash;but, at length, he gained the
upper floor, and his deliverer exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks, he is safe! by this good hand, too, that
wrought your misery. Oh! that a life of penitence and
prayer might atone for my guilt. It was a thought inspired
by Heaven, prompted me to set on fire that insatiate demon,
to whom my task-master offered those wretched victims, and
every month a bride, on pain of his own destruction. What
might be the nature of that skeleton form, or their compact,
thou canst neither know nor understand. Even I, though
nightly witnessing horrors which have given to youth the
aspect and decrepitude of age, cannot explain. A connexion,
if not inseparable, yet intimate as body and soul, existed
between those demon-haunted bones, and yon monster
who sought, and accomplished my ruin. What I have seen
must not, cannot be told. My lips are for ever sealed. But
the flames are fast gaining on us. Let us hasten, ere they
prevent our retreat. The whole fabric will shortly be enveloped,
and every record of this diabolical confederacy consumed.
Go to thy lady-love. She is recovered, and, as one
newly awakened from some terrific dream. With the earliest
dawn hie thee to the prison lest <i>he</i> escape. Let him
be instantly secured. When summoned I will not fail, to
confront, to denounce the wretch. He cannot penetrate
yonder walls, save by fraud or strategem. How I have escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
death is one of the mysteries which time perchance
may never develope. One might fancy the cunning leech
who supplied the drug did play me false. Instead of poison
mayhap, one of those potions of which we have heard,
that so benumb and stupify the faculties, that for a space
they mimic death&mdash;nor can any thing rouse or recover
from its influence until the appointed time be past."</p>

<p>They hurried away as he spoke. De Vessey could
scarcely wait until daylight. His first care was to secure
the old sorcerer. He sought aid from the police, and, as far
as might be, revealed the dreadful secret.</p>

<p>An immediate visit was made to the cell. On entering,
its inmate was in bed,&mdash;a scorched, a blackened corpse!</p>

<p>It may be supposed, the lover was not long in attending
on his mistress. She was free from disorder, and happily
unconscious of what had passed during the interval, save
that an ugly dream had troubled her. Nor was she aware
that more than one night had elapsed. In a few days afterwards,
De Vessey led her to the altar.</p>

<p>The mystery was never fully penetrated. That imposture,
and partial insanity, might be involved, and have the
greatest share in its development, is beyond doubt; but
they cannot explain the whole of these diabolical proceedings.
That the powers of darkness may have power over
the bodies of wicked and abandoned men, cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Whether this narration discloses another instance of such
mysterious agency, our readers must determine.</p>

<p>What the painter knew, was buried in eternal silence.
The monks of La Trappe received a brother whose vows
were never broken!</p>

<h2>THE CRYSTAL GOBLET:</h2>

<h4>A TALE OF THE EMPEROR SEVERUS.</h4>


<p>It was midnight,&mdash;yet a light was burning in a small chamber
situated in one of the narrowest and least frequented
streets of Eboracum,&mdash;then the metropolis of the world.
York at that period being the residence of the Emperor
Severus, his court and family were conveyed hither; and
the government of the world transferred to an obscure
island in the west: once the <i>ultima Thule</i> of civilization,
its native inhabitants hardly yet emerged from a state
of barbarism, and addicted to the most gross and revolting
superstitions.</p>

<p>A lamp of coarse earthenware was fastened on a bronze
stand, having several beaks, and of a boat-like shape. Near
it stood the oil-vase for replenishing, almost empty,&mdash;while
the wicks, charred and heavy with exuvi&aelig;, looked as though
for sometime untrimmed. On the same table was a Greek
and a Coptick manuscript, an inkhorn, and the half of a
silver penny, the Roman <i>symbolum</i>. Breaking a piece of
money as a keepsake, between two friends, was, even at that
period, a very ancient custom. A brass rhombus, used by
magicians, lay on a <i>cathedra</i>, or easy chair, which stood as
though suddenly pushed aside by its occupier in rising
hastily from his studies. An iron chest was near, partly
open, wherein papers and parchments lay tumbled about in
apparent disorder. Vellum, so white and firm, as to curl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
even with the warmth of the hand; purple skins emblazoned
in gold and silver, and many others, of rare workmanship,
were scattered about with unsparing profusion. It was
evidently the study, the <i>librarium</i> of some distinguished
person, and consisted of an inner chamber beyond the court,
having one window near the roof, and another opening into
a small garden behind. From the ceiling there hung a dried
ape, a lizard, and several uncouth, unintelligible reptiles, put
together in shapes that nature's most fantastic forms never
displayed. Vases of ointments, and unguents of strange
odours, stood in rows, upon a marble slab on one side of the
apartment. <i>Scrinia</i>, or caskets for the admission of rolls,
and writing materials were deposited on shelves, forming a
library of reference to the individual whose <i>sanctum</i> we are
now describing: It was, apparently, undisturbed by any
living occupant, save a huge raven, now roosting on a
wooden perch, his head buried under a glossy tissue of feathers,
and, to all appearance, immovable as the grinning and
hideous things that surrounded him. A magpie, confined in
a cage above the door, was taught to salute those who
entered, with the word "&#967;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#949;," a Grecian custom, greatly in
vogue amongst the most opulent of the Romans.</p>

<p>Ere long, there came a footstep,&mdash;and a gentle summons at
the door. The bird gave the usual response; and straightway
entered a stout muscular figure, wrapped in a <i>chlamys</i>,
fastened on the shoulder with a richly-embossed <i>fibula</i>.
Beneath, was the usual light leathern cuirass, covered with
scales of shining metal; the centre, over the abdomen, ornamented
with a gorgon's head, and other warlike devices; a
short sword, being stuck in his girdle. From the lowest
part hung leathern straps, or <i>lambrequins</i> highly wrought
and embellished. He wore breeches or drawers, reaching
to the knees, and his feet and the lower part of the leg were
covered with the <i>cothurnus</i>, a sort of traveller's half-boot.
A sumptuous mantle, made of leopard skin, was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
carelessly about his head, hardly concealing his features; for
the folds relaxing in some measure as he entered, showed a
youthful countenance; yet dark and ferocious, indicating a
character of daring and vindictive energy; and a disposition
where forgiveness or remorse rarely tempered the fiercer
passions. As he looked round, the raven raised his head on
a sudden, and peering at him with that curious and familiar
eye, so characteristic of the tribe, gave a loud and hollow
croak, which again arrested the notice of the intruder.</p>

<p>"Most auspicious welcome truly, ill omened bird. Is thy
master visible?"</p>

<p>There was no reply; and the inquirer, after a cautious
glance round the chamber, sat down, evidently disconcerted
by this unexpected reception. Scarcely seated, he felt the
clasp on his shoulder suddenly risen, as though by an intruder
from behind. Looking round, he saw the raven with
the bauble in his beak, hopping off with great alacrity to his
perch. The magpie set up a loud scream as though vexed
he was not a participator in the spoil. The owner, angry at
his loss, pursued the thief, who defied every attempt to regain
it; getting far above his reach; ever and anon the same
ominous croak sounding dismally through the gloom by
which he was concealed. Finding it fruitless, the stranger
gave up the pursuit, and again sat down, examining carelessly
the papers which lay open for perusal. But it might
seem these feathered guardians were entrusted with the care
of their master's chamber during his absence.</p>

<p>"Beware!" said the same querulous voice, that before
accosted him. Looking up, he saw the magpie, his neck
stretched to the utmost through the bars of his cage, and in
the act of repeating the injunction.</p>

<p>"'Tis an ill augur to my suit," he muttered hastily.
"Destiny!" Starting up at the word, which he spake aloud,
he clenched his hand.</p>

<p>"The inexorable gods may decree, but would it not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
worthy of my purpose to brave them; to render even fate
itself subservient to me!"</p>

<p>He hurried to and fro across the chamber with an agitated
step. Suddenly he stood still, in the attitude of listening.
He drew the folds of his mantle closer about his head, when
by another entrance, there approached a tall majestic figure,
clad in dark vestments, who without speaking, came near
and stood before him. A veil of rich net-work fell gracefully
below his mantle, being in that era, the distinctive garb
of soothsayers and diviners. His hair, for he was an
Asiatic, was twisted in the shape of a mitre, investing his
form with every advantage from outward appearances.</p>

<p>"I would know," said he, "by what right thou art at this
untimely hour, an intruder on my privacy?"</p>

<p>"By a will, which even thou darest not disobey," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"It is past midnight. Knowest thou of my long watching,
and the dark portents of the stars?"</p>

<p>"Nay! But passing, I saw the door of the vestibule
partly open. The fates were propitious. I crossed the
court, intending to consult the most famous soothsayer in
the emperor's dominions."</p>

<p>"Peradventure 'tis no accidental meeting. To-night I
have read the stars, the book of heaven. Comest thou not,
blind mortal at their bidding?"</p>

<p>"I have neither skill nor knowledge in the art&mdash;&mdash;,"</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated, as though he had as lief the conversation
was resumed by the diviner himself.</p>

<p>"Thy father. What of him?" said the Chaldean, with a
look, as though he had penetrated his inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>"True, 'tis mine errand," said the intruder. "But the
event?"</p>

<p>"The augury is not complete!"</p>

<p>"Thine auguries are like my good fortune,&mdash;long in compassing.
The best augur I trow, is this good steel. I would
sooner trust it than the best thou canst bestow."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rash mortal. Impatience will be thy destruction.&mdash;Listen!"</p>

<p>The raven hopped down upon his shoulder. A low
guttural sound appeared to come from this ill-omened bird.
The augur bent his ear. Sounds shaped themselves into
something like articulation, and the following couplet was
distinctly heard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While the eagle is in his nest, the eaglet shall not prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall the eagle be smitten in his eyrie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Azor," said the warrior, clenching his sword, "these
three times hast thou mocked me, and by the immortal
gods thou diest!"</p>

<p>"Impious one! I could strike thee powerless as the
dust thou treadest on. Give me the bauble," said he,
addressing the raven. The bird immediately gave the clasp
he had purloined into his master's hand.</p>

<p>"This shall witness between us," continued he. "Dare
to lift thy hand, the very palace shall bear testimony to
thy treason&mdash;that thou hast sought me for purposes too
horrible even for thy tongue to utter. Hence. When least
expected I may meet thee. If it had not been for thy
mother's sake, and for my vow, the emperor ere this had
been privy to it."</p>

<p>Stung with rage and disappointment, he put back his
weapon, and with threats and imprecations departed.</p>

<p>On a couch inlaid with ivory and pearl, within a vaulted
chamber in the Pr&aelig;torian Palace of the royal city, lay the
emperor, in a coverlid of rich stuff. Disease had crushed
his body, but the indomitable spirit was unquenched.
Tossing and disturbed, at length he started from his bed.
Calling to his chamberlain, he demanded if there had not
been footsteps in the apartment. The ruler of the world,
whose nod could shake the nations, and whose word was
the arbiter of life or death to millions of his fellow-men,
lay here&mdash;startled at the passing of a sound, the falling of
a shadow! His face, whose chief characteristic was power,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
strength and determination of spirit which all acknowledge,
and but few comprehend&mdash;was furrowed with
deeper marks than care had wrought. Sixty years had
moulded the steady and inflexible purpose of his soul in
lines too palpable to be misunderstood. His beard was
short and grizzled; and a swarthy hue, betraying his
African birth, was now become sallow, and even sickly in
the extreme; but an eagle eye still beamed in all its fierceness
and rapacity from under his scanty brows. His nose
was not of the Roman sort, like the beak of that royal
bird, but thick and even clumsy, lacking that sharp and
predacious intellect generally associated with forms of this
description.</p>

<p>Such was Septimus Severus, then styled on a coin just
struck, "<span class="smcap">Britannicvs Maximvs</span>," in commemoration of a
great victory gained over the Caledonians, whom he had
driven beyond Adrian's wall. Though suffering from severe
illness, he was carried in a horse-litter; and, marching
from York at the head of his troops, penetrated almost to
the extremity of the island, where he subdued that fierce
and intractable nation the Scots. Returning, he left his
son Caracalla to superintend the building of a stone wall
across the island, in place of the earthen ramparts called
Adrian's;&mdash;a structure, when completed, that effectually
resisted the inroads of those barbarians for a considerable
period.</p>

<p>He called a third time to Virius Lupus, one, the most
confidential of his attendants, to whom many of the most
important secrets of the state were entrusted.</p>

<p>"Thrice have I heard it Virius. Again, and again, it
seems to mock and elude my grasp." He paused: the
officer yet listening with becoming reverence. The Emperor
continued, more like one whose thoughts had taken
utterance, than as if he were addressing the individual
before him.</p>

<p>"When I led the Pannonian legions to victory; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Rome opened her gates at my command; when I fought
my way through blood to the throne,&mdash;I quailed not then!
Now,&mdash;satiated with power, careless of fame, the prospects
of life closed, and for ever,&mdash;when all that is left for me to
do is to die,&mdash;behold, I tremble at the shaking of a leaf!
I start, even at the footstep that awakes me!"</p>

<p>"Long live the Emperor!" said the cringing secretary.
Interrupting him, as he would have proceeded with the
customary adulations, the emperor again continued as
though hardly noticing his presence.</p>

<p>"Caracalla yet remains with the army. Once I censured
the misguided clemency of Marcus, who, by an act of
justice might have prevented the miseries that his son
Caligula brought upon the empire; and yet I, even I,"
said the haughty monarch, bitterly, "nourish the very
weakness that in others I despise!"</p>

<p>He dashed away the sweat from his brow, ashamed of
the weakness he could not quell.</p>

<p>"He hath sought your life," said the wily sycophant.</p>

<p>"He hath!&mdash;Traitor! parricide! the distinctions he
would have earned. But my better genius triumphed, and
history hath been spared this infamy. It may be, this
temporary exile from our court, with the northern army,
shall tame his spirit to submission. My life or his, once
the bitter alternative, may yet be avoided."</p>

<p>"But may not his presence with the army be impolitic,
should he turn the weapon wherewith you have girded him
to your own hurt?"</p>

<p>"'Tis an evil choice; whichever way I turn, mischief is
before me."</p>

<p>"Were it not best that he be recalled?"</p>

<p>"What! to plot and practise against my life? To mount
upon my reeking body to the throne! He will not reign
with Geta. The proud boy disdains a divided empire.&mdash;And
was not mine own soul fashioned in the same mould?
When Niger would have ruled in Syria, and Albinus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Britain, I scattered their legions to the winds, and levelled
their hopes with their pride. 'Tis nature: and shall I, the
author of his being, punish him for mine own gift?"</p>

<p>He raised himself on his couch. The fierce blaze of
ambition broke the dark cloud of bodily infirmities, and the
monarch and the tyrant again dilated his almost savage
features.</p>

<p>The secretary, used to these fiery moods, stood awaiting
his commands. The emperor, as though exhausted, sunk
down on his pillow, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have governed the world, but I cannot govern a
wayward heart!"</p>

<p>Thus did he often lament, and provoke himself the more
with these vain regrets; forgetting that, if he had exercised
the same firmness in his private as public capacity,
the government of his own house would have been easy
as the government of the world.</p>

<p>"Virius Lupus there is danger,&mdash;and to-night. As I have
told thee, the stars do betoken mischief. But the peril is
at my threshold. Let Caracalla remain; so shall we avert
his weapon. Should the assassin come, it will not be with
the blow of a parricide. Thou mayst retire to thy couch,
but, first, let the guards be doubled, the watchword and
countersign changed. And, hark thee, tell the tribune that
he look well to the <i>tessera</i>, and have the right count from
the inspectors. Should despatches come from Rome, let the
messenger have immediate audience."</p>

<p>Again the emperor stretched himself on the couch, and
again his slumbers were interrupted. A murmur was
heard along the halls and passages where the guards were
stationed. The noise grew louder, approaching the very
door of the royal chamber. The monarch started, as from
a dream, and the door at that moment opened. The
Chald&aelig;an soothsayer stood before him.</p>

<p>"Azor!" said the Emperor, "at this hour? What
betides such unseemly greeting?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar trembles on his throne; but the world quakes
not! The angel of death is at thy door. Caracalla hath
returned."</p>

<p>"Returned? Surely thy wits are disturbed. Caracalla!
Aye, even yesterday, we had despatches from the camp."</p>

<p>"Howbeit, he is at thy threshold. The sound of his
feet is behind me."</p>

<p>"Impossible! the mischief is not from him."</p>

<p>"Even now I looked in the crystal, and behold&mdash;&mdash;"
The soothsayer paused. Horror was gathering on his
features. The light suspended above him began to quiver;
and, as it waved to and fro, his countenance assumed a
tremulous and distorted expression.</p>

<p>Severus watched the result with no little anxiety. The
magician drew a crystal cup from his girdle. Looking in,
apparently with great alarm, he presented it at arm's length
to the emperor, who beheld a milky cloud slowly undulating
within the vessel.</p>

<p>"Take this," said the soothsayer, "and tell me what thou
seest."</p>

<p>The monarch took it at his bidding. The cloud seemed
to be clearing away, as the morning mist before the sun.</p>

<p>"I see nothing," said the emperor, "but a silver clasp at
the bottom."</p>

<p>"And the owner?"</p>

<p>"As I live," said the astonished parent, drawing forth
a curiously embossed clasp from the goblet, and holding it
out to the light, "this token of rare workmanship did the
Empress present to Caracalla, ere he departed. Whence
came it? and wherefore hast thou brought it hither?"</p>

<p>"A silent witness to my word. Within the hour thy son
returns; and&mdash;&mdash;" The seer's voice grew more ominous
whilst he spake. "Beware! there's mischief in the wind.
The raven scents his prey afar off!"</p>

<p>"If in this thou art a true prophet, I will give thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
largess; but if a lying spirit of divination possess thee, my
power is swift to punish as to reward."</p>

<p>"I heed not either. Do I serve thee for lucre? Look
thee, in less time than I would occupy in telling thee on't I
could fill thy palace with gold and silver! and do I covet
thy paltry treasures? The kingdoms of this world are his
whom I serve, and shall I seek thy perishing honours?
Behold, I leave this precious goblet as my pledge. I
must away. Thou shall render it back on my return. I
would not part with that treasure for the dominion of the
C&aelig;sars. Beware thou let it not forth from thy sight, for
there be genii who are bound to serve its possessor, and,
peradventure it shall give thee warning when evil approaches."</p>

<p>The soothsayer departed, and the emperor laid the crystal
goblet on a table opposite his couch. He clapped his hands,
and the chief secretary approached.</p>

<p>"What said our messenger from the north? Read again
the despatch they brought yesterday."</p>

<p>The secretary drew forth a roll from his cabinet, and read
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Again the supreme gods have granted victory to our
legions. Favoured by the darkness and their boats, the
barbarians attacked us from three separate points. Led on
by Fingal and his warriors, whom beforetime we erroneously
reported to be slain, they crossed over to the station where
we had pitched our tents. But the Roman eagle was yet
watchful. Though retreating behind our last defences, we
left not the field until a thousand, the choicest of our foes,
bit the dust. Morning showed us the red-haired chief and
his bards, but they were departing, and their spears were
glittering on the mountains."</p>

<p>"Enough!" said the emperor. "Caracalla tarries yet
with the camp. Our person is not menaced by his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Prithee send a brasier hither. The night is far spent, and
slumber will not again visit these eyelids."</p>

<p>A bronze tripod was brought, supported by sphinxes, the
worship of Isis being a fashionable idolatry at that period.
Charred wood was then placed in a round dish, pierced with
holes, and perfumes thrown in to correct the smell. The
emperor commanded that he should be left alone. Covering
his shoulders with a richly-embroidered mantle, he took
from behind his pillow a Greek treatise on the occult
sciences, to the study of which he was passionately addicted.</p>

<p>It is said of him, by historians, that he was guided by his
skill in judicial astrology to the choice of the reigning
empress, having lost his first wife when governor of the
Lyonnese Gaul. Finding that a lady of Emesa, in Syria,
one Julia Domna, had what was termed "a royal nativity,"
he solicited and obtained her hand, thus making the prophecy
the means of its accomplishment.</p>

<p>A woman of great beauty, and strong natural acquirements,
she was, at the same time, the patron of all that was
noble and distinguished in the philosophy and literature of
the age. It was even said that, secretly, she was a favourer
of the Christians. Be this as it may, we do not find she
ever became a professor of the faith.</p>

<p>Sleep, that capricious guest, which comes unbidden, but
not invited, was just stealing over the monarch's eyelids,
when the roll fell from his grasp. The unexpected movement
startled him. His eye fell on the bright crystal
opposite. He thought a glimmer was moving in the glass.
He remembered the words of the sage, and his eye was
riveted on the mystic goblet. A sudden flash was reflected
from it. He started forward, when a naked sword fell
on the couch! the stroke he only escaped by having so
accidentally changed his place. The glass had revealed
the glitter of the blade behind him, and he was indebted
to a few inches of space for his life!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking round, he beheld a masked figure preparing to
repeat the stroke. Severus, with his usual courage and
presence of mind, threw his mantle across the assassin's
sword. He cried out, and the chamber was immediately
filled with guards; but, whether from treachery or inadvertence,
the traitor was no where to be found. He had
escaped, leaving his weapon entangled in the folds of the
mantle. On examination, the emperor's surprise was visibly
increased, when he recognised the sword as one belonging
to Caracalla! The soothsayer's prediction was apparently
fulfilled. To the emperor's superstitious apprehensions the
crystal goblet was charged with his safety. But, lo! on
being sought for, the charmed cup was gone!</p>

<hr style="width: 33%;" />

<p>The next morning, as the sun was just rising over the
green wolds, and the fresh air came brisk and sharply on
the traveller's cheek, a stranger was noticed loitering
through the narrow streets of the imperial city. He had
passed the great Calcarian or western gate, from which the
statue of the reigning emperor, on that memorable morning,
was found razed from its pedestal. The outer and inner
faces of the gate were whitened for the writing of edicts
and proclamations by the government scribes, and likewise
for the public notices of minor import, these being daubed
on the walls with various degrees of skill, in red or black
pigments, according to the nature of the decrees that were
issued by the Pr&aelig;tor and the caprice of the artist.</p>

<p>On that morning a number of idlers had assembled about
the gate. The statue of the emperor, fallen prostrate, had
been removed, and an edict promptly supplied, to the
purport that an impious hand, having attempted the life of
the monarch, a reward of one hundred thousand <i>sestertia</i>
would be the price of his apprehension. Another reward
of the like sum was offered for the discovery of a crystal
goblet, stolen from the emperor's chamber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>The individual we have just noticed wore the common
sleeved tunic of coarse wool; over it was a cloak buckled
on the right shoulder, the yarn being died in such wise that,
when woven, it might resemble the skin of a brindled ox&mdash;such
was the dress of the ancient Britons. His head was
covered with a close cap, but his feet were naked; and the
only weapon he bore was a two-handed sword, stuck in his
girdle.</p>

<p>Ere he passed the gate, it might be supposed that his
business and credentials would have been rigidly scrutinised
by the guards; but he merely showed a large signet ring
to the superior officer, and was immediately allowed to
pass. He soon came to the wooden bridge over the river,
now kept by a body of the Pr&aelig;torian guards. Here, on
attempting to pass, he was immediately seized. With an
air of stupid or affected concern, the prisoner drew the
same signet from his hand, the sight of which again procured
him immediate access. The bridge was crossed, and,
after passing along the narrow, winding streets, he came to
a small triumphal arch leading into the Forum. This was
an area of but mean extent, surrounded by a colonnade,
serving as a market for all sorts of wares, and the trades
carried on under its several porticoes. The outer walls,
behind the columns, were painted in compartments, black
and red, and here a number of citizens were assembled.
There was hurrying to and fro. Soldiers and messengers,
even so early, were bustling about with ominous activity.
The stranger looked on for awhile, with a vacant sort of
curiosity, then, turning to the left hand, went forward
towards the gate of the palace. On a corner of the building
he saw another edict to the same purport as before.
Near it was the announcement of a spectacle at the theatre:
the gift of a wealthy patrician for the amusement and gratification
of the people. Still the stranger passed on, apparently
uninterested by all, until he came to the outer gate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
where he merely paused a few moments, as though to observe
the movements of the soldiers and the changing of
the guard. The sound of the trumpet seemed to attract
especial notice from this barbarian, whose uncouth air and
rude manners drew upon him the gaze of many as they
passed by. He now turned into a narrower street behind
the palace, and here he sought out a common tavern, where
the chequers, newly painted on the door posts, betokened
good entertainment for travellers. Having entered, the
hostess, whose tucked-up dress and general appearance,
Martial, in his epigrams, so cunningly describes, brought
him a vase or flagon of wine. It was not of the true
Falernian flavour, as may be readily surmised, but a mixture
of stuff, which can hardly be described, of nauseous taste,
smelling abominably of resin or pitch, and flavoured with
myrrh and other bitters. Both hot and cold refections
solicited the taste, and regaled the sight of the visitor.
Flitches of bacon were suspended from above, and fire-wood
stuffed between the rafters, black and smoky with the reeking
atmosphere below. At his own request, the stranger
was installed in a small chamber behind the public room,
where stood a couch, a three-footed table, and a lavatory.
Here he was served with radishes, cheese, and roasted eggs,
in earthen vessels, with a relish of cornels in pickle. Ere
this refection was brought in, the table was rubbed over
with a sprig of mint, and the coarse pottery betrayed an
exquisite odour of thyme and garlic.</p>

<p>After the needful refreshments and ablutions, he sallied
forth, first inquiring for the residence of the Chaldean
soothsayer, before whose door, in due time, he arrived. The
gate leading to the vestibule was open, and he entered by
a narrow passage terminated by a small inner court. He
paused, and looked round. No fountain played in the
centre; a clump of rank, unwholesome grass was the only
decoration, but the object of his search was a crooked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
wooden staircase, which led to a sort of gallery above.
After a little hesitation, he ascended; his country manners
showing a determination to persevere until fairly delivered
of his errand. A door at the extremity of the gallery stood
ajar, and through this he made bold to enter. A Numidian
slave, dwarfish and deformed, was sweeping his master's
chamber. He stopped short as the barbarian, with a stupid
and wondering look, entered the apartment. After surveying
the new comer with an air of deliberate scrutiny, the
dwarf burst forth into a violent fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"Mercury hath sent us precious handsel this morning,
truly," said he, when his diversion was concluded. "A
pretty hound to scent out master's lost goods. The gods
do verily mock us in thy most gracious person."</p>

<p>The visitor looked on with dismay during this ungracious
and taunting speech. At length he stammered forth,</p>

<p>"Thy master, is he not the Chaldean to whom my mistress,
knowing I was bound for the city, hath sent me
privily with a message?"</p>

<p>The Briton spoke this in a sort of guttural and broken
Latin, which the apish dwarf mimicked in the most mischievous
and provoking way imaginable. The messenger,
irritated beyond endurance, placed both hands on his weapon,
but his antagonist, with little ado, tripped up his heels, and
the poor aborigine was completely at the mercy of this grotesque
specimen of humanity.</p>

<p>Grinning over him with spite and mischief in his looks,
the dwarf stamped on the floor; presently there came two
slaves, who, without further notice than a blow now and
then when resistance was offered, bound him with stout
cords, and bade him lie there until he should be further
disposed of. Inquiry was vain as to the cause of this treatment.
Bound hand and foot, he was then tossed with little
ceremony, and less compunction, into a corner of the room;
and there left to bemoan his hard fate. Perched just above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
his head, sat the cunning raven, who eyed him as though
with serious intentions of pecking at him in his present
defenceless condition. He was soon aware of this additional
source of alarm, and as the bird's eye brightened
and twinkled with greedy anticipation, he rubbed his
rapacious beak on the perch, apparently whetting it for
the feast. He then jumped down on the floor, and hopping
close to his victim, gave a hoarse and dismal croak, a death
warning, it might be, to the unfortunate captive. He tried
to burst his bonds, and shrieked out in the extremity of
his alarm. His struggles kept the bird at a distance, but
it continued to survey him with such a longing, liquorish
eye, that the poor culprit felt himself already writhing, like
another Prometheus, under the beak of his destroyer. His
terror increased. It might be some demon sent to torment
him; and this conviction strengthened when he saw the
dismal and hideous things that surrounded him. Just as his
agony was wrought to the highest pitch, he heard footsteps.
Even the sound was some relief. He knew not what further
indignities&mdash;not to say violence&mdash;he might expect; but at all
events, there would be a change, and it was hailed as an
alleviation to his misery.</p>

<p>The soothsayer presented himself, attended by the ugly
dwarf.</p>

<p>"A stupid barbarian thou sayest the Fates have sent us?"
said the Chaldean, as he entered. "Bridle thine impious
tongue, Merodac; what the dweller in immortal fire hath
decreed, will be accomplished, though by weak and worthless
creatures such as these. What ho! stranger, whence art
thou? and why art thou moved so early across our
threshold?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said the prisoner, in a tone of entreaty, "these
bonds are unlawful&mdash;I am a freed man. Though a Briton,
I am no slave, and I beseech you to visit this indignity on
that rogue, who hath so scurvily entreated me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was privy to it, else would he not have dared this."</p>

<p>"And to what end, good master?"</p>

<p>"That we may have an answer propitious to our suit."</p>

<p>"What! are ye about to sacrifice me to your infernal
deities!" cried the captive, almost frantic with the anticipation.</p>

<p>"My friend, thou art bound for another purpose; to wit
that, through thy instrumentality, we may discover the
divining cup the emperor hath lost. Knowest thou aught
of this precious crystal?" inquired the Chaldean, with a
searching look.</p>

<p>But it were vain to describe the astonishment of the victim.
He looked almost in doubt of his own identity, or as
if he were trying to shake off the impression of some
hideous dream. At length he replied,</p>

<p>"'Tis some device surely, that ye may slay me!"</p>

<p>He wept; and the tears trickling down his cheek, were
indeed piteous to behold, "I know not," said he, "your
meaning. Let me depart."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the soothsayer, "thou mayest content thyself
as thou list, but the cup shall be found, and that by
thy ministry. The emperor hath offered rewards, nigh to
the value of three silver talents, for the recovery, and
assuredly thou shalt be held in durance until it be regained."</p>

<p>"And by whose authority?" inquired the Briton.</p>

<p>"Why, truly, it becometh thee to ask, seeing thou art a
party interested in the matter. The emperor, in whose care
the jewel was left, hath sworn by the River Styx, that unless
the cup be brought back to the palace ere to-morrow's
dawn, he will punish the innocent with the guilty; and that
with no sparing hand. He hath already laid hands on some
of the more wealthy citizens, and amerced them in divers
sums; others are detained as hostages for suspected persons
who are absent from the city. The loss of this cup being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
connected with a daring attempt on the emperor's life by
some unknown hand, he doth suspect that the very palace
wants purging from treason; yet where to begin, or on whom
to fasten suspicion, he knoweth not. Mine art has hitherto
failed me in the matter. The tools they work with baffle
my skill, save that the oracle I consult commanded that I
should lay hold on the first male person that came hither to-day,
and by his ministry the lost treasure should be restored.
Shouldest thou refuse, thou art lost; for assuredly
the emperor will not be slow to punish thy contumacy."</p>

<p>The miserable captive fell into great perplexity at this
discourse. He vowed he knew no more of the lost cup
than the very stones he trod on; that he had come since
nightfall from his master, Lucius Claudius, lieutenant and
standard-bearer of the sixth legion, then at Isurium,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> on a
mere casual errand to the city; and that his mistress, who
was a British lady of noble birth, had instructed him, at the
same time, to consult the soothsayer on some matters relative
to her nativity, which the sage had calculated some years
back. Almost a stranger in these parts, how could he pretend
to begin the search? He begged piteously for his release;
promising, and with great sincerity, that he would
never set foot in this inhospitable region again. The magician
inquired his name.</p>

<p>"Cedric with the ready foot," was the reply. Unmoved
by his entreaties, the soothsayer said he had the
emperor's command for the use of every method he could
devise for the recovery of this precious and priceless jewel;
and that, furthermore, the safety, and even lives of many
innocent persons depended on the stranger's exertions, and
the speedy execution of his mission. But how to begin, or
in what quarter to commence the search, was a riddle worthy
of the Sphinx. A most unexpected and novel situation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
this rude dweller in woods and morasses, to be suddenly
thrust forth into a mighty city, without guide or direction,
more ignorant of his errand than any of its inhabitants.
Besides, he was not without a sort of incipient and instinctive
dread, that the catastrophe might procure him an interview
with the emperor; and he was filled with apprehension
lest his own carcase might afford a special treat, a
sacrifice to the brutal appetite of the spectators in the amphitheatre,
after the manner of the <i>bestiarii</i>, or gladiators, of
whom he had often heard. Even could he have gotten word
of this mishap to his master, he was by no means certain it
would be attended with any beneficial result. The time was
too short, and the will and mandate of the emperor would
render futile any attempt to obtain deliverance from this
quarter.</p>

<p>A few moments sufficed for these considerations. The
glance of the mind, when on the rack for expedients, is
peculiarly keen, and hath an eagle-like perception that
appears as though it could pierce to the dim and distant
horizon of its hopes and apprehensions.</p>

<p>"Unbind these withes," said the captive, "I cannot begin
the search in this extremity."</p>

<p>"Merodac, undo these bonds; and see thou guard thy
prisoner strictly:&mdash;thy life answers for his safe keeping."</p>

<p>The dwarf, who seemed never so well pleased as when
tormenting the more fortunate and better shapen of his
species, unloosed the cords with something of the like feeling
and intention as a cat when liberating some unfortunate
mouse from her talons.</p>

<p>"There's a chance of rare sport i' the shows to-morrow,"
said the ugly jailor. "We are sure of <i>thee</i>, anyhow.&mdash;Didst
ever see the criminals fight with wolves, Hyrcanian
bears, and such like? I would not miss the sight for the
best feather in my cap."</p>

<p>The cruel slave here rubbed his hands, and his yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
eyes glistened with the horrible anticipation. His victim
groaned aloud.</p>

<p>"I'll tell thee a rare device," continued he, "whereby
thou mayest escape being eaten, at least a full hour; and we
shall have the longer sport. Mind thee, the beasts do not
always get the carcases for dinner. If they be cowardly,
and show little fight, we give the dead bestiarii to the dogs.
I remember me well the last we threw into the emperor's
kennel, the dogs made such a fighting for the carrion, that
he ordered each of us a flagellation for the disturbance.
Let me see, there was&mdash;ay&mdash;" here the knave began to
count the number of shows and human sacrifices he had
seen, recounting every particular with the most horrible
minuteness. Cedric felt himself already in the gripe of the
savages, and his flesh verily quivered on his bones.</p>

<p>Brutal and demoralising were those horrid spectacles. The
people of Rome, it has been well observed by a modern
writer, were generally more corrupt by many degrees than
has been usually supposed possible. Many were the causes
which had been gradually operating towards this result, and
amongst the rest, the continual exhibition of scenes where
human blood was poured forth like water. The continual
excitement of the populace demanded fresh sacrifices, until
even these palled upon the cruel appetites of the multitude.
Even the more innocent exhibitions, where brutes were the
sufferers, could not but tend to destroy all the finer sensibilities
of the nature. "Five thousand wild animals, torn from
their native abodes in the wilderness and the forest," have
been turned out for mutual slaughter in one single exhibition
at the amphitheatre. Sometimes the <i>lanista</i> or person who
exhibited the shows, and provided the necessary supplies,
by way of administering specially to the gratification of the
populace, made it known, as a particular favour, that the
whole of these should be slaughtered. These, however, soon
ceased to stimulate the appetite for blood. From such combats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
"the transition was inevitable to those of men, whose
nobler and more varied passions spoke directly, and by the
intelligible language of the eye, to human spectators; and
from the frequent contemplation of these authorised murders,
in which a whole people&mdash;women as much as men, and
children intermingled with both, looked on with leisurely
indifference, with anxious expectation, or with rapturous
delight, whilst below them were passing the direct sufferings
of humanity, and not seldom its dying pangs, it was
impossible to expect a result different from that which did,
in fact, take place&mdash;universal hardness of heart, obdurate depravity,
and a twofold degradation of human nature, the
natural sensibility and the conscientious principle." "Here
was a constant irritation, a system of provocation to the
appetite for blood, such as in other nations are connected
with the rudest stages of society, and with the most barbarous
modes of warfare."</p>

<p>"Whither wilt thou that we direct our steps?" inquired
Merodac, with mock submission, when the cords were unloosed.</p>

<p>"Lead the way&mdash;I care not," said his moody victim,
"'tis as well that I follow."</p>

<p>A bitter and scornful laugh accompanied the reply of the
dwarf.</p>

<p>"That were a pretty device truly,&mdash;to let thee lag behind,
and without thy tether. Ah, ah," chuckled the squire
as they left the chamber; "Diogenes and his lantern was a
wise man's search compared with ours."</p>

<p>How the slave came to be so learned in Grecian lore,
we know not. His further displays of erudition were cut
short by the soothsayer, who cried out to him as they departed,</p>

<p>"Remember, thy carcase for his, if he return not."</p>

<p>Now, in York, at this day, may be observed, where an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
angle of the walls abuts on the "Mint Yard," a building
named "the Multangular Tower," and supposed to have
been one of the principal fortifications of the city. However
this might be, its structure has puzzled not a little,
even those most conversant with antiquities. The area was
not built up all round, but open towards the city. The
foundations of a wall have latterly been discovered, dividing
it lengthwise through the centre, and continued, for
some distance, into the town; so that the whole may not
inaptly be represented by a Jew-trump&mdash;the tongue being
the division, the circular end the present Multangular
Tower, continued by walls on each side. This building, we
have every reason to conjecture, was the Greek <i>stadium</i> or
Roman circus, which authors tell us was a narrow piece of
ground shaped like a staple; the round end called the barrier.
The wall dividing it lengthwise is the <i>spina</i>, or flat
ridge, running through the middle, which was generally
a low wall, and sometimes merely a mound of earth. This
was usually decorated with statues of gods, columns, votive
altars, and the like. As a corroboration of this opinion,
there have been found here several small statues, altars,
and other figures, betokening a place of public resort or
amusement.</p>

<p>The circus was not used merely for horse and chariot-races,
but likewise for wrestling&mdash;the <i>c&aelig;stus</i>, and other
athletic games. It was noted as the haunt of fortune-tellers,
and thither the poorer people used to resort, and
hear their fortunes told.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>Near this place stood the barracks, or <i>castra</i>. Long
ranges of rooms, divided into several stories, the doors of
each chamber opening into one common gallery, ascended
by a wooden staircase.</p>

<p>Hither we must conduct our readers, at the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
day on whose inauspicious morning "Cedric with the
ready foot," was placed in such jeopardy.</p>

<p>The whole city meanwhile had been astir. The emperor's
wrath and desire of revenge were excited to the
utmost pitch. He suspected treachery even amongst the
Pr&aelig;torian guards,&mdash;his favourite and best-disciplined
troops; and there was an apprehension of some terrible disgrace
attaching even to them. Still, nothing further transpired
implicating the soldiery, save that the assassin had
escaped, and, apparently, through the very midst of the
guard; yet no one chose to accuse his fellow, or say by
whose means this mysterious outlet was contrived. Not
even to his most confidential minister did the emperor reveal
the discovery of his son's weapon. Neither that son, nor
his guilty accomplices, if any, could be found; and the day
was fast closing upon the monarch's threat, that on the
morrow his vengeance should have its full work, unless the
crystal goblet was restored.</p>

<p>There had been a public spectacle at the theatre, but the
emperor was not present; and such was the consternation
of the whole city, that the performance was but scantily
attended. The city was apparently on the eve of some sad
catastrophe, and the whole population foreboding some
fearful event.</p>

<p>In the circus were yet some stray groups, who, having
little employment of their own, were listening for news, and
loitering about, either for mischief or amusement.</p>

<p>In one part was exhibited a narrow wooden box, not
unlike to our puppet-show, wherein a person was concealed,
having figures made of wood and earthenware, that seemed
to act and speak, to the great wonder and diversion of the
audience.</p>

<p>As the rays of the declining sun smote upon the city
walls and the white sails of the barks below, there came
into the circus the dwarf, who had charge of Cedric. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
captive now looked like a sort of appendage to his person&mdash;being
strapped to his arm by a stout thong of bull's hide,
such as was used for correcting refractory slaves. The
hours allotted for search were nearly gone. Day was drawing
to a close, and Cedric had done little else than bemoan
his hard fate. The whole day had been spent in wandering
from place to place, urged on by the scoffs and jeers of his
companion. Some furtive attempts to escape had been the
cause of his present bondage. Hither, at length, they arrived.
Tired and distressed, he sat down on one of the
vacant benches, and gave vent to his sorrows in no very
careful or measured language.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" said he, "a stranger in this great
city&mdash;to set me a-finding what I never knew? A grain
of wheat in a barn full of chaff, mayhap&mdash;a needle in a
truss of hay&mdash;anything I might find, but what was sheer
impossible. And now am I like to be thrown to the dogs,
like a heap of carrion!"</p>

<p>"But the oracle, friend."</p>

<p>"Plague on the oracle, for&mdash;&mdash;" Here his speech was
interrupted; for happening to look up, he saw, as he fancied,
the eyes of one of the little figures in the show-box ogling
him, and making mouths in such wise as to draw upon him
the attention of the spectators, now roaring with laughter
at his expense. Reckless of consequences, and almost furious
from sufferings, he suddenly jumped up, and dragging
the dwarf along with him, made a desperate blow at the
mimic, which, in a moment, laid sprawling a whole company
of little actors, together with the prime mover himself,
and the showman outside to boot. The fray, as may readily
be conceived, waxed loud and furious. The owners and
bystanders not discriminating as to the main cause of the
attack, would have handled both the keeper and the captive
very roughly, had not the noise awakened the attention of
the soldiers in the neighbouring barracks. Hearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
affray, a party ran to ascertain the cause of the disturbance,
and seeing two men whom a whole crowd had combined to
attack, concluded they were culprits, and forthwith hailed
them before the captain of the guard, a centurion, Diogenes
Verecundus by name.</p>

<p>Cedric and the dwarf, being rescued from a sound beating,
began to abuse one another, as the cause of the disturbance;
but the officer, by dint of threats and inquiries,
soon learned the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>"Thank the stars, I shall be rid of this pestilence to-morrow,"
said Merodac; "my master could not have found
me such another; and how the Fates could pitch upon such
a sorry cur for the business, seems passing strange. If he
find the cup, I'll be beaten to a jelly in it. Thy carcase will
be meat for the emperor's hounds to morrow."</p>

<p>"If, as thou sayest," said the centurion, "thou art so
mightily weary of thy charge, leave him to my care; I
would fain have some discourse with him privily, touching
what thou hast spoken."</p>

<p>The slave hesitated.</p>

<p>"On the word of a Roman soldier he shall be forthcoming.
Tell thy master that Verecundus the centurion, hath
taken thy prisoner captive. Here is money for thee."</p>

<p>The Ethiop showed his teeth, like ivory studs on a coral
band, while the rings shook in his wrinkled ears, as he took
the largess. Yet his brow contracted, and he hung his
head. He hesitated to unloose the bonds.</p>

<p>"By what token?" he at length inquired.</p>

<p>"By this!" said the centurion, taking up a thong for his
correction. "Stay," continued he, laying it down, "I will
not punish thee undeservedly. Take these, they will bear
thee harmless with thy master."</p>

<p>The dwarf took the writing thankfully, and made the best
of his way to the dwelling of the soothsayer.</p>

<p>The officer now beckoned Cedric that he should follow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
In a low room by the guard-chamber at the gate, the following
conversation took place.</p>

<p>"There is evil denounced us of a truth," said Verecundus;
"but it may be the gods have sent thee hither for our
rescue, as the oracle hath said."</p>

<p>The Briton fixed his wondering eyes on the soldier, whilst
he continued.</p>

<p>"I have pondered the words well, and if thou prove
trusty, ere this night pass, the plot shall be discovered, and
the ringleaders secured. We have need of such an one as
thou"&mdash;a stranger, whom they will not suspect, and will
use the intelligence he obtains with a vigilant and cunning
eye. There is work for thee, which, if well done, may
bring thee to great wealth and honour. If thou fail, we fall
together in the same ruin. There is a plot against the
emperor; and one which hath its being, ay, in the very
secrets of the palace. Those nearest him, I am well assured,
are the chief movers in the conspiracy. 'Tis this makes it
so perilous to discover, and without a fitting agent the
mischief will not be overcome. I have thought to throw
myself at the emperor's feet, but having no proof withal to
support my suspicions, I should, in all likelihood, fall a
sacrifice to my own fidelity."</p>

<p>"But how," asked the bewildered Cedric, "shall I discover
them? Verily, it doth seem that to-day I am
destined to work out impossibilities. How it comes to pass
that a poor ignorant wretch like myself, should compass
these things, it faileth my weak fancy to discover!"</p>

<p>"The soothsayer's speech is not lightly to be regarded.
Hark thee, knave! Is life precious unto thee?"</p>

<p>"Yea, truly is it. I have a wife and children, besides a
few herds and other live stock, likewise sundry beeves i' the
forest. But, unless I can find favour in your eyes, my
goods, alas! I am not like to see again."</p>

<p>"Nor wilt thou, peradventure, again behold the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
yon blessed sun which hath just gone down. The shades of
evening are upon us, and the shadows of death are upon
thine eyelids; for, hark thee, I do suspect some treasonable
message in thine errand to the city."</p>

<p>Cedric, with a look of terror and incredulity, stammered
out,</p>

<p>"As I live, I know not thy meaning!"</p>

<p>"Thou art in my power; and, unless thou servest me
faithfully, thou diest a cruel and fearful death. What was
the exact message wherewith thou wast entrusted?"</p>

<p>The Briton's countenance brightened as he replied,</p>

<p>"I give it thee, with right good will. No treason lurks
there, I trow. 'Take this,' said my master, yesternight,
giving me a signet ring; 'take it to York by day-break.
At the gate show it to the guard. If they let thee pass,
well. If not, return, for there is mischief in the city. At
the bridge, shouldest thou get so far, again show it, where,
I doubt not, thou shalt find thereby a ready passage. Seek
thee out some by-tavern, where thou mayest refresh; then,
about mid-day go into the street called the goldsmiths', and
there inquire for one Caius Lupus, the empress's jeweller.
Show him the signet, and mark what he shall tell thee.'"</p>

<p>"Thou hast given him the signet then?" said the centurion,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Nay. For my mistress, as ill luck would have it, hearing
of my journey, and she having had some knowledge of the
soothsayer's art aforetime, bade me consult him ere my
errand was ready with the goldsmith, and deliver a pressing
request for the horoscope which had been long promised.
What passed then, as thou knowest, is the cause of my
calamity."</p>

<p>"But didst thou not search out the dwelling of this same
Caius, and do thine errand?"</p>

<p>"I did. But in the straits which I endured, I was not
careful to note the time. An hour past mid-day, I sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
out his dwelling; but he was gone to the palace on urgent
business with the empress, nor was it known when he
might return."</p>

<p>"Sayest thou so, friend? I would like to look at this same
potent talisman."</p>

<p>Cedric drew forth the ring. It was a beautiful onyx, on
which, engraven with exquisite workmanship, was a head
of the youthful Caracalla, encircled by a laurel wreath,
showing marks of the most consummate skill.</p>

<p>"Was thine errand told to the soothsayer?" was the next
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Verily nay," said the messenger; "there was little space
for parley ere I was thrust forth."</p>

<p>"He saw not the signet, then?"</p>

<p>"Of a truth it has not been shown, save to the guards
for my passport."</p>

<p>"Now, knave, thy life hangs on a thread so brittle that
a breath shall break it. This same goldsmith I do suspect;
but thou shalt see him, and whatsoever he showeth, I will
be at hand that thou mayest tell me privily. I will then
instruct thee what thou shalt do. If thou fail not in thy
mission, truly thou shalt have great rewards from the emperor.
But if thou whisper&mdash;ay to the walls&mdash;of our meeting,
thou diest! Remember thou art watched. Think not to
escape!"</p>

<p>The poor wretch caught hold on this last hope of deliverance,
and promised to obey.</p>

<p>There was a narrow vault beneath the women's apartments
in the palace, communicating by many intricate
passages, with an outlet into the Forum. Here, on this
eventful night, was an unusual assemblage. The vault was
deep, even below the common foundations of the city, and
where the light of day never came. An iron lamp hung
from one of the massy arches of the roof; the damp and
stagnant vapours lending an awful indistinctness to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
objects they surrounded. Chill drops lay on the walls and
on the slippery floor. The stone benches were green with
mildew; and it seemed as though the foot of man had rarely
passed its threshold.</p>

<p>In this chamber, several individuals were now assembled
in earnest discourse, their conversation whispered rather
than spoken; yet their intrepid and severe looks, and animated
gestures, ever and anon betrayed some deep and
resolute purpose more than usually portentous.</p>

<p>"An untoward event truly," said one of the speakers,
Virius Lupus himself, the emperor's private secretary. "If
the old magician could have been won, it had been well."</p>

<p>"He might have saved the encounter and hazard we
must now undergo. But let him hold his fealty. We have
stout hearts and resolute hands enow to bring the matter to
a successful issue." Thus spoke Caracalla, the unnatural
eldest born of his father.</p>

<p>"And yet," replied the secretary, "he hath a ready admittance
to his person, and a great sway over thy father's
councils."</p>

<p>"I heed him not, now that brave men work. It were
time that our trusty servant, the commander at Isurium, had
sent the message, with the token I left him on my departure.
Ere this, we ought to have known the hour we may
expect his troops to move on the capital. I had thought to
have made all safe; to have put it beyond the power of fate
to frustrate our purpose; but I was foiled like a beardless
boy at his weapons." He gnashed his teeth as he spoke;
and this monster of cruelty breathed a horrible threat against
the life even of a parent and a king.</p>

<p>"Here is the roll," said one, who from his inkhorn and
reed-pen seemed to be the scribe; and whose ambition had
been lured by a promise that he should have the office of
sextumvir in the imperial city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here be the names and disposition of the troops; the
avenues and gates to which they are appointed."</p>

<p>"We but wait a messenger from Isurium to make our
plans complete," said Caracalla. "By the same courier I
send back this cypher. Examine it, Fabricius. The troops
of Lucius Claudius are to march directly on the Forum, and
slay all who attempt resistance. Thou, Virius Lupus, wilt
guide them through the secret passage into the palace."</p>

<p>The secretary bowed assent.</p>

<p>"Though the empress knows not our high purpose, it is
by her connivance we are here, safe from the emperor's
spies. Under her mantle we are hidden. Suspicion hath
crossed her that I am about to head the troops; that my
father, oppressed with age and infirmities, will retire to
Rome; and that I, Caracalla, rule in Britain."</p>

<p>"Then she knows not the mishap of yesternight?"</p>

<p>"She knows of the attempt, but not the agent. I would
the messenger were come. 'Tis an unforeseen delay. I
pray the gods there be not treachery somewhere. The
officers and guard at the Calcarian gate and the bridge are
ours; they were instructed to obey the signet."</p>

<p>"We will vouch for their fidelity," said two or three of
the conspirators.</p>

<p>"Should he not arrive before midnight, we must strike,"
said Fabricius.</p>

<p>"Ay, as before," said the more cautious secretary. "But
we may now get a broken head for our pains."</p>

<p>"The time brooks not delay," said Caracalla. "Every
moment now is big with danger to our enterprise."</p>

<p>"Be not again too hasty," replied the secretary, "there
be none that will divulge our plans. Let every part be
complete before we act. We cannot succeed, should there
be a disjointed purpose."</p>

<p>Caracalla vehement, and unused to the curb, was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
to reply, when the door opened and a dumb slave slowly
entered. He crossed his hands, and pointed to the door.</p>

<p>"A messenger," said they all.</p>

<p>"The gods are at last propitious," said Caracalla. "Let
him approach."</p>

<p>Soon one was led in by the sentinel, blindfolded, and the
latter immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>"The sign," cried the secretary.</p>

<p>The stranger, without hesitation, presented a ring.</p>

<p>"'Tis the same," said Caracalla. He touched a concealed
spring in the signet, and from underneath the gem drew
forth a little paper with a scrap of writing in cypher. It
was held before the lamp, and the intelligence it contained
rendered their plot complete. Ere break of day the deed
would be accomplished. The morning would see Caracalla
proclaimed, and Severus deposed.</p>

<p>"Have ye any token to my master?" inquired the
messenger.</p>

<p>"Take back this writing," said Virius Lupus. "Thou
wilt find him not far from the city. We wait his coming."</p>

<p>"This leaden-heeled Mercury should have a largess," said
the chief, "but in this den we have not wherewithal to
give him. Hold! here is a good recompence, methinks,"
continued he, taking the crystal goblet from a recess.
"Take this to thy mistress, and tell her to buy it from thee.
We will see her anon. That charmed cup hath foiled me
once, but I will foil thee now, and the powers thou servest.
Thou shall not again cross my path!"</p>

<p>Cedric took the gift, wrapping it beneath his cloak.</p>

<p>"Thou mayest depart."</p>

<p>The dumb sentinel again took charge of him, and led
him away by many intricate passages towards the entrance,
where it seems the goldsmith had directed him on presenting
the signet of Caracalla. The person who took charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
of him was a dumb eunuch, a slave in the service of the
empress.</p>

<p>But the terrors of death were upon the wretched victim.
He knew the centurion would assuredly be at hand to
receive his report, and he could not escape. He had not
brought back one word of intelligence; and, being blindfolded,
he knew not whither he had been taken. The
writing he carried would assuredly be unintelligible, save
to those for whom it was intended. His mission, he could
perceive, had utterly failed. The centurion would not be
able to profit by any thing he had brought back, and must,
inevitably, according to his pledge, at once render him up
to the soothsayer. Whilst ruminating on his hard fate, a
sudden thought crossed him. There was little probability of
success; but, at all events, it might operate as a diversion in
his favour, and the design was immediately executed. Skulking
for a moment behind the slave, he tore off the bandage,
and tripped up the heels of his conductor. Before the latter
could recover himself, the Briton's gripe was on his throat.</p>

<p>"Now, slave, thou art my prisoner! Lead on, or, by this
good sword, thou diest!"</p>

<p>The torch he carried was, luckily, not extinguished in
the fall. The eunuch, almost choaking, made a sign that he
would obey. With the drawn blade at his throat, the slave
went on; but Cedric, ever wary, and with that almost instinctive
sagacity peculiar to man in his half-civilised state,
kept a tiger-like watch on every movement of his prisoner,
which enabled him to detect the fingers of the slave suddenly
raised to his lips, and a shrill whistle would have consigned
him over to certain and immediate destruction; but he
struck down the uplifted hand with a blow which made his
treacherous conductor crouch and cringe almost to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Another attempt," said Cedric, "and we perish together!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>The wily slave looked all penitence and submission.
Silently proceeding, apparently through the underground
avenues of the palace, Cedric was momentarily expecting his
arrival at the place where the centurion kept watch. A
flight of steps now brought them to a spacious landing-place.
Suddenly a lamp was visible, and beneath it sat a number of
soldiers, the emperor's body-guard. They gave way as the
eunuch passed by, followed by Cedric, his sword still drawn.
Several of these groups were successively cleared: the
guide, by a countersign, was enabled to thread his way
through every obstacle that presented itself. The Briton's
heart misgave him as they approached a vestibule, before
which a phalanx of the guards kept watch. Here he
thought it prudent to sheath his weapon, though he still
followed the eunuch, as his only remaining chance of
escape. Even here they were instantly admitted, and
without any apparent hesitation. The door turned slowly
on its pivot, and Cedric found himself in a richly decorated
chamber, where, by the light of a single lamp, and with
the smell of perfumed vapour in his nostrils, he saw a figure
in costly vestments reclining on a couch. The slave prostrated
himself.</p>

<p>"What brings thee from thy mistress at this untimely
hour? A message from the empress?"</p>

<p>Here the speaker raised himself from the couch, and the
slave, with great vehemence, made certain signs, which the
wondering Briton understood not.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the emperor, his eyes directly levelled at the
supposed culprit; "thou hast found the thief who, in the
confusion of yesternight, bore away the magic cup. Bring
him hither, that I may question him ere his carcase be sent
to the beasts."</p>

<p>The doomed wretch was now fairly in the paws of the
very tyrant he had so long dreaded. The death, which by
every stratagem he had striven to avoid, was now inevitable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
He was betrayed by means of the very device he
had, as he thought, so craftily adopted; but still his natural
sagacity did not forsake him, even in this unexpected
emergency. As he prostrated himself, presenting the cup
he had stowed away safely in his cloak, he still kept a wary
eye on the slave who had betrayed him. He saw him preparing
to depart; and, knowing that his only hope of deliverance
lay in preventing his guide from giving warning
to the conspirators they had just left, Cedric, with a sudden
spring, leaped upon him like a tiger, even in presence of the
monarch.</p>

<p>The latter, astounded at this unexpected act of temerity,
was for a few moments inactive. This pause was too
precious to be lost. Desperation gave him courage, and
Cedric addressed the dread ruler of the world even whilst
he clutched the gasping traitor.</p>

<p>"Here, great monarch, here is the traitor; and if I prove
him not false, on my head be the recompense!"</p>

<p>He said this in a tone of such earnestness and anxiety
that the emperor was suddenly diverted from his purpose of
summoning his attendants. He saw the favourite slave of
the empress writhing in the gripe of the barbarian; but the
events of the last few hours had awakened suspicions which
the lightest accusations might confirm. He remembered
his son's guilt, the facility of his escape; and it might be
that treason stood on the very threshold, ready to strike.
He determined to sift the matter; and, the guard now
summoned, the parties were separated,&mdash;each awaiting the
fiat of the monarch.</p>

<p>"Where is Virius Lupus?" was the emperor's first
inquiry.</p>

<p>"He hath not returned from the apartments of the
empress."</p>

<p>"Let this slave be bound," cried Cedric. "Force him to
conduct you even to the place whence, blindfold, he hath just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
led me; and if you find not a nest of traitors, my own head
shall be the forfeit."</p>

<p>Dark and fearful was the flash that shot from the emperor's
eye on the devoted eunuch. Pale and trembling he
fell on his knees, supplicating, with uplifted hands, for
mercy. He knew it was vain to dissemble.</p>

<p>"And what wert thou doing in such perilous company?"
inquired the emperor, turning to Cedric, and in a voice
which made him shrink.</p>

<p>"Let the centurion, Diogenes Verecundus, be sought
out. He waits my return by the Forum Gate. To him
the city owes a discovery of this plot, and Rome her
monarch!"</p>

<p>The faithful centurion was soon found. The eunuch
conducted them secretly to the vault. The conspirators
were seized in the very height of their anticipated success.
The roll containing the names of the leaders, the plan of
attack, and the disposition of the rebellious troops, was
discovered; and the morning sun darted a fearful ray on
the ghastly and bleeding heads uplifted on the walls and
battlements of the imperial palace.</p>

<p>But with misplaced clemency the monster Caracalla was
again pardoned. The centurion Diogenes Verecundus was
raised to the dignity of Sexumvir. The only reward
claimed by the generous and sturdy Briton was an act of
immunity for his master, who was merely dismissed from
his post and banished the kingdom.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>One morning, during Mr. Roby's stay at Keswick, in September
1849, it was reported that the floating island in the lake was
making its appearance. He immediately took a boat, and we
hastened with a friend to the spot. The island was plainly to be
seen at a short distance below the surface of the water, nearly
approaching it in some parts, in others gradually retreating beyond
our sight. It was easily touched with a stick, and appeared
covered with vegetation. We grappled up with the boat-hook,
and brought away, as a memento of our visit, a specimen of the
<i>Isoetes Lacustris</i> (European quill-wort), a plant which grows
abundantly at the bottom of the lakes in this district. The boatmen
rowed carefully about, afraid of passing over the island, lest
the boat should run aground. It gave a strange feeling thus to
find land coming up where, a few days before, we had floated in
deep water. It did not rise any higher, but, after continuing for
a day or two in the state just described, sank gradually to its old
position at the bottom of the lake. The last time it was visible,
some years since, it rose above the surface.</p>

<p>It lies at some distance from the shore on the Barrow side of the
lake, between the Barrow landing and Lodore. It was near the
former spot that we gathered the <i>Circ&aelig;a Alpina</i> (Alpine Enchanter's
Nightshade) in fruit, growing side by side with the <i>Silene
Maritima</i> (Sea Campion). The botanical reader will, perhaps,
feel an interest in the notice of two or three other localities of the
rarer plants. In the same direction, high up among the rocks,
near Ashness Gill, Mr. Roby found the <i>Oxyria reniformis</i> (Kidney-shaped
Mountain-sorrel.) The <i>Salix Herbac&aelig;a</i> (Least Willow),
the smallest of British trees, and <i>Lycopodium Alpinum</i> (Savin-leaved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Club-moss), on Skiddaw, their well known habitat; the
latter plant also, with the <i>Alchemilla Alpina</i> (Alpine Lady's-mantle),
its silvery leaves glistening in the sun, on the mountain-side opposite
Honister Crag. In the wild and shady nooks of Borrowdale,
the <i>Polypodium Phegopteris</i> (Pale Mountain-polypody) and the
<i>P. Dryopteris</i> (Tender Three-branched Polypody), growing in
charming profusion. And on Dunmail Raise, and on the precipitous
descent of the Stake between Langdale Pikes and Bowfell, the
golden stars of the <i>Saxifriga Azoides</i> (Yellow Mountain-saxifrage)
were still sparkling, where a little moisture allowed them to
flourish.</p>

Orion, June, 1850, when <span class="smcap">God</span>, in His inscrutable providence, cut
short a life so incomparably precious, was even then matter of
thankfulness. Many portions of the MS., from which the legends
in this volume were printed, bear traces of the sad catastrophe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> The notion of this huge stone being a boulder stone&mdash;perhaps
from Norway, which was long believed, is now exploded. A friend
at Keswick (Sept. 1853) writes me word that the Porphyritic greenstone
of which it is composed, runs through many parts of the Lake
district, in the immediate neighbourhood, and that this stone must
have fallen from the cliff just above. My informant adds, that Mr.
Wright, the well known guide, in company with a gentleman,
measured the stone and the cavity whence it fell, and found them
to correspond; though the cavity is now somewhat overgrown by
grass, it is not difficult to perceive.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Robert Langland's Visions of Pierce Plowman, were written
about the year 1362. He represents himself as falling asleep on
the Malvern Hills, and there beholding a series of visions, in describing
which, he takes occasion to satirise the vices prevailing in
the different classes of society, particularly the corruptions of the
clergy. His prediction of the Reformation in England is most remarkable.
As the date of these visions preceded Chaucer twenty
years, the author must be considered the first English poet. He
was a native of Shropshire, and fellow of Oriel College. Whitaker,
who styles him the father of English Poetry, does not confirm the
supposition that he was a monk of Worcester or Malvern. He
thus paraphrases the opening lines.
</p><p>
"In early summer while sunshine was mild, I withdrew myself
into a solitary place, surrounded with shrubs, in habit not like an
Anchorite who keeps his cell, but like one of those unholy hermits
who wander about the world to see and hear wonders; and on a
May morning, reclining in a glade among the Malvern Hills, I
slept from fatigue, and dreaming, beheld all the wealth and woe of
the world."&mdash;<i>Whitaker's (of Whalley) Ed. of Pierce Plowman:</i>
1813.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> To strangers as well as residents we were much indebted. We
received both the warmest sympathy and personal kindness from
the Rev. J. Clarke, Incumbent of Stretford near Manchester, whose
interesting narrative, published under the title of "<i>The Wreck of
the Orion</i>," contains a full account of the mournful catastrophe.
And never can be erased from memory the debt of kindness due to
an English clergyman of the Episcopal Church in Scotland&mdash;the
Rev. &mdash;&mdash; Pugh&mdash;who had come to seek his lovely little girl who had
just perished in the wreck. The sympathy and encouragement he
afforded touching that one supreme desire, and his offer, beyond
all price, to take charge of the remains so unutterably dear, with
those of his own beloved child, fill the heart with a weight of thankfulness
that cannot be expressed. I can only look forward to that
world where all the lovely will be gathered together, and the tears
wiped from the mourner's eyes, as they already have been from
those of the beloved ones we weep over.</p></div>

friends. The incessant invention required to sustain the wit of
three, and sometimes four, interlocutors, combined with the physical
effort, kept the powers of both mind and body on the stretch
to a degree that exhausted him more than anything else in which
he engaged. See <i>Stewart's Phil. Hum. Mind</i>. III. 229&mdash;224.</p></div>

Gospatrick held lands of Ernais de Buron in the county of York, as
appears by Domesday Book. Sir Nicholas Byron distinguished himself
in the civil wars of Charles I.; and, in consequence of his zeal in the
royal cause, the manor of Rochdale was sequestered. After the Restoration,
it reverted to the Byrons. Sir John, during these troubles,
was made a peer, by the title of Baron Byron of Rochdale. In 1823,
the late Lord Byron sold the manor, after having been in possession of
the family for nearly three centuries.</p></div>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
